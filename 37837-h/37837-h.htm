<h2 id="PETER_AND_POLLY">PETER AND POLLY</h2>

<p>Peter Howe is a little boy. Polly is his
sister. She is older than Peter.</p>

<p>They live in a white house. The house
is on a hill. It is not in the city. It is
in the country.<span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>There are no houses close about it.
But there are trees and fields around it.</p>

<p>In summer these fields are green. In
winter the snow covers them.</p>

<p>The fields and the hills are as white as
the house. Then there is fun playing in
the snow.</p>

<p>Peter likes to watch the snowflakes. He
calls them "white butterflies." But he
knows what they are.</p>

<p>His friend, the Story Lady, told him.
They are just frozen clouds.</p>

<p>Peter said to her, "I think they are
prettier than raindrops. They can sail
about in the air, too. Raindrops cannot.
I like winter better than summer."</p>

<p>"It will be winter soon, Peter," said the
Story Lady. "But many things must
happen first.</p>

<p>"The birds must fly away. The leaves
must turn red and yellow. Then they
will fall and you can rake them into heaps.
We will go to the woods for nuts.</p>

<p>"All these things will happen before
winter comes."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter. "And my grandmother
must knit me some thick stockings.<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
And my father must buy me a
winter coat. Grandmother must knit some
stockings for Wag-wag, too."</p>

<img src="images/illus009.jpg" width="396" height="266" alt="" />

<p>"But Wag-wag is a dog, Peter. Dogs
do not need stockings."</p>

<p>"My dog does," said Peter. "He needs
a coat, too. His hair is short. It will
not keep him warm. I shall ask father
to buy him a coat."</p>

<p>"Do, Peter," said the Story Lady. "It
is good to be kind to dogs. And when
Wag-wag wears his coat and stockings,
bring him to see me. I will take his picture."</p>

<h2 id="THE_BIRDS_GAME_OF_TAG">THE BIRDS' GAME OF TAG</h2>

<p>It is fall. Summer is really over. But
it is still warm. Jack Frost has not yet
begun his work.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly have been watching the
birds. For days they have seen great
flocks of them. In the summer there were
not so many together.</p>

<p>One day they saw several robins. These
were flying from tree to tree.</p>

<p>Peter said, "I know they are having a
party. They are playing tag."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are," said his father.
"Perhaps each bird is telling something to
the bird he tags."</p>

<p>"What is he telling?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"I think he is saying, 'Brother bird,
don't you know that winter is coming?
Soon the snow will be here. What shall
we do then?</p>

<p>"'We cannot get food. We shall freeze.<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
Come, let us fly away to the South. It
is warm there.'"</p>

<img src="images/illus011.jpg" width="388" height="442" alt="" />

<p>"What does brother bird say?" asked
Peter.</p>

<p>"I think brother bird says, 'It is a long
way to the South. It will take many days
and nights to fly there.</p>

<p>"'Are our children's wings yet strong<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
enough? I do not like to go. But I know
that we must.'"</p>

<p>"Doesn't he like to go, truly?" asked
Peter.</p>

<p>"We do not know, Peter. The robins
make their nests here. They lay their blue
eggs here. They hatch their little birds
here. They never do this in the South.</p>

<p>"Besides, they sing their beautiful songs
here. They never sing them in the South.
We like to think that they love the North
better. But, of course, we do not know."</p>

<p>"How can they find their way back?"
asked Polly.</p>

<p>"We do not know that, either, Polly.
Many birds fly in the nighttime. Then
they rest a part of the day."</p>

<p>"I couldn't find my way in the dark,"
said Polly.</p>

<p>"But the birds can," said father. "We
do not know how. The winter home of
some of our birds is thousands of miles
from here."</p>

<p>"I like to watch the swallows," said Polly.
"They sit in a line on a telephone wire.
Then one flies to another wire. In a minute
they all fly, too.<span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>"I think that they are talking about going
away soon. I hope they will not get
lost."</p>

<p>"Yes," said father. "They will soon be
gone. But perhaps some of these very birds
will come back here next summer."</p>

<p>"I wish we could know them," said Polly.</p>

<p>"We shall have a few birds left this
winter," said father. "You know some of
them. You know the chick-a-dees and the
woodpeckers. And this winter I shall show
you others."</p>

<p>"May we hunt for nests and eggs, father?"
asked Peter.</p>

<p>"We may hunt, Peter, but we won't find
any eggs in winter. We shall find other
things. Perhaps we shall find the white-footed
mouse. He sometimes makes his
home in an old bird's nest."</p>

<p>"Can a mouse climb trees, father? If
he lives in a bird's nest, does he lay bird's
eggs?"</p>

<p>"He can climb trees, Peter. But he cannot
lay eggs. We will see if we can find
Mr. White-foot some day.</p>

<p>"But first we will watch the birds fly
away and the snow come."</p>

<h2 id="THE_STONE-WALL_POST_OFFICE">THE STONE-WALL POST OFFICE</h2>

<p>Around Peter's house is a beautiful field.
This is Mr. Howe's hayfield. You can find
it on the map in the front of this book.</p>

<p>The children like this field. All the year
round, it is a pleasant place.</p>

<p>In the spring they find blue violets here.
In the summer they watch the birds that
make nests in the tall grass. In the winter
they slide here on the crust.</p>

<p>At the farther side of the field, there are
some trees. These are butternut trees. In
front of the trees is a stone wall.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly like to play by this
wall. Sometimes they play that it is a
post office.</p>

<p>The holes in the wall are the boxes.
There is a box for every one in the village.
Peter has more than one box; so has Polly.<span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>The children take turns being the postmaster.
If Peter is the postmaster, Polly
calls for the mail.</p>

<p>The real post office is in their father's
store. So they have often seen Mr. Howe
put the mail into the boxes.</p>

<p>They use little sticks for the post cards.
Leaves are the letters. Stones are the
packages. Sometimes the boxes are full
of mail&mdash;especially
Peter's and Polly's.</p>

<img src="images/illus015a.jpg" width="208" height="159" alt="" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/illus015b.jpg" width="390" height="272" alt="" class="splitr" />

<p>Often they play
that it is Christmas
time. Then the
boxes are full of<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
packages. It is fun to guess what is in
each package.</p>

<p>One day Peter said, "There is a knife in
this package. I like it. There is a hammer
in this package. I will build a house with it.</p>

<p>"There is a game in this package. Will
you play it with me, Polly? And, O Polly!
There is a pony in this package! That is
what I wish for most of all."</p>

<p>"But, Peter, a pony is too big to be in
your post-office box. It would not come
by mail."</p>

<p>"Then Santa Claus will bring it," said
Peter. "If I get it, I do not care how it
comes."</p>

<p>One day the children saw that the butternuts
were falling.</p>

<p>Polly said, "Let's pick up all we can.
We will put them in our post-office boxes.
When they are full, we will bring your
cart. Then we can take the nuts home.
We will crack them next winter."</p>

<p>So they filled the boxes with nuts. The
nuts were still green. The children stained
their hands with them.</p>

<p>While they were playing with the nuts,
they saw two squirrels. These sat in the<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
trees above them. They watched Peter and
Polly with their bright eyes, and scolded
them a great deal.</p>

<p>"They want our nuts," said Polly. "But
we have put them into our post-office boxes.
We will keep them."</p>

<p>The next day the children went for their
nuts. They took Peter's cart with them.
What do you think they found?</p>

<p>Why, they found their boxes empty! The
nuts were all gone!</p>

<p>"Some one bad has been here," said Peter.</p>

<p>Polly laughed. "You always say that,
Peter. I think it was those squirrels. And
I don't care, because they need the nuts to
eat this winter."</p>

<p>"I don't care, either," said Peter. "I
think we forgot to lock our boxes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we did," said Polly. "But I
guess the squirrels thought the boxes were
theirs. When they called for their mail,
they found the boxes full. How pleased
they must have been! Let's pick up more
nuts for them."</p>

<p>So the children again filled the post-office
boxes with nuts. Then they went home
and left them for the squirrels.</p>

<h2 id="PLAYING_IN_THE_LEAVES">PLAYING IN THE LEAVES</h2>

<p>One day Peter saw something that
pleased him. It was a branch of red leaves
on a maple tree.</p>

<p>He said to mother, "It will be winter
soon."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so, Peter?"</p>

<p>"I have seen red leaves," said Peter.</p>

<p>"But, Peter, a few red leaves do not
count. There are red leaves in the summer.
You must watch until you see many red,
yellow, and brown leaves."</p>

<p>"What makes the leaves red and yellow,
mother? Is it magic?" asked Peter. "Can
you do it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a kind of magic, Peter. It
is like the clouds turning into snow. I cannot
do that."</p>

<p>Then Peter watched for all the trees to
turn. At last they were bright with colors.<span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>The maples were red and yellow; the
oaks a deep red. The beeches were a bright
yellow.</p>

<p>Even the elm trees in front of the house
were yellow. Now Polly liked more than
ever to swing. The swing took her way up
among the yellow leaves.</p>

<p>Then, one day, the leaves began to fall.
Down they came, a few at a time. The next
day more fell, and the next and the next.</p>

<img src="images/illus019.jpg" width="398" height="220" alt="" />

<p>Polly said, "They are prettier than the
snowflakes. The snow is white. These
have lovely colors. See them flying through
the air."</p>

<p>At last most of the trees were bare. The
leaves lay on the ground.</p>

<p>Then Peter said, "Oh, the poor trees!<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
They haven't any clothes on. I am so
sorry."</p>

<p>Polly said, "The leaves are not clothes.
They are children. Now they have gone to
bed. The snow is their blanket. When it
comes, it will keep them warm. If we
leave them alone, they will sleep all winter.
I learned it in a poem."</p>

<p>"They cannot go to sleep yet," said Peter.
"I shall not let them. I shall wake them
up."</p>

<p>"How will you do that?" asked Polly.</p>

<p>"I shall run in them. That will keep
them awake. I shall do it now. Come
on! See if you can make as much noise as
I can."</p>

<p>After a while the children raked the leaves
into large heaps. Then they jumped in the
heaps. This scattered the leaves. But the
children did not care. They raked them up
again.</p>

<p>Once Peter jumped where the leaves were
not very deep. He came to the ground with
a bang. He was surprised. But he was
not much hurt.</p>

<p>He said to mother, "My teeth shut with a
noise when I went down."<span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>Mother said, "It is lucky that your tongue
was not in the way. You would have bitten
it badly."</p>

<img src="images/illus021.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="" />

<p>"Come in now, both of you. You must
wash your hands and faces. Father will be
home soon. You may play in the leaves to-morrow."</p>

<h2 id="THE_BONFIRE">THE BONFIRE</h2>

<p>The next day father said, "Peter and
Polly, will you work for me? I wish to buy
your leaves. I will give you a cent for
three loads."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, goody!" said Polly.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, goody!" said Peter.</p>

<p>"You must put the leaves in a pile in the
garden. I will show you where."</p>

<p>"What will you do with them, father?"
asked Polly.</p>

<p>"You will see to-night, if you are good
workmen."</p>

<p>In the night the wind had blown the
leaves about. So the children raked them
up once more.</p>

<p>Then they filled the big basket full.<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
They packed in the leaves as hard as they
could.</p>

<p>"That is to give good measure," said
Polly. "Father always gives good measure
at his store. So you and I must, too."</p>

<p>Every time they took a basketful to the
garden, Polly made a mark on a piece of
paper.</p>

<p>At last the yard was raked clean. They
had taken to the garden twenty-nine loads.
They had worked nearly all day.</p>

<p>At supper father said, "You are good
workmen, chicks. Our yard looks very
clean. It is ready for winter.</p>

<p>"You piled the leaves carefully in the
garden, too. Now, how much do I owe
you?"</p>

<p>"We took twenty-nine loads, father,"
said Polly. "I wish there had been one
more to make thirty."</p>

<p>"Why do you wish that, Polly?"</p>

<p>"Because three goes in thirty better than
in twenty-nine."</p>

<p>"Well," said father, "we will call it thirty
loads, Polly. I saw you packing the leaves
into the basket very hard.</p>

<p>"You are honest workmen to give me<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
such good measure. Now, Polly, three goes
in thirty how many times?"</p>

<p>"Ten times, father. So you owe us ten
cents. We shall each have five cents."</p>

<p>"Very good, Polly. Here is your money.
I have a surprise for you. Put on your
coats and come to the garden. Mother will
come, too."</p>

<p>In the garden they found father beside
the pile of leaves. He had thrown many
things upon it.</p>

<p>He said, "I came home early and cleaned
up the garden. Now, what shall we do
with all this stuff?"</p>

<p>"Burn it, burn it!" shouted both children
at once. "A bonfire, a bonfire!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said father. "You may burn
it. Here is a match for you, Polly. And
here is one for you, Peter. Light your fire."</p>

<p>Polly and Peter lighted the great heap.
Soon the red flames were leaping up. They
made the garden bright. Farther away from
the fire it was very dark.</p>

<p>"Oh, see, see, mother!" cried Polly.
"The flames are as pretty as the red and
yellow leaves. Have they taken the color
from the leaves? How hot they are!"<span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_HEN_THAT_HELPED_PETER">THE HEN THAT HELPED PETER</h2>

<p>Peter is a nice little boy. But he can be
very naughty. Mother and father know
this. Grandmother Howe and Polly know
it, too.</p>

<p>You see, Peter always wishes his own
way. And you know this is not good for
little boys and little girls.</p>

<p>Peter cannot have cake between his meals.
He may always have milk to drink. Sometimes
he may have bread and jelly, or bread
and sugar.</p>

<p>He likes this very much. But he does not<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
like the crusts of the bread. So he used to
eat only the soft part. The crusts he threw
away.</p>

<p>But at the table he could not throw
them away.</p>

<p>Then he put them under the edge of his
plate. You know how.</p>

<p>When mother took the plate, there would
be a crust on the table. It did not look very
well.</p>

<p>One day father said, "Peter, you are a
big boy now. You are nearly five years
old. You are old enough to eat your crusts.</p>

<p>"I will give you a week in which to learn
how. After that, I shall not expect to see
any more crusts on the table."</p>

<p>Peter knew that, when his father spoke so,
he meant what he said. But the little boy
thought he would not eat his crusts until he
had to do so.</p>

<p>He said to himself, "In a week I will begin
to eat them all up. But now I will still
put them under my plate."</p>

<p>So, every day when his plate was taken
away, there were the crusts. Peter did not
see his father look at them. And his father
said nothing more about them.<span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>By and by Peter began to think that his
father had forgotten.</p>

<p>So, when the week was over, he said to
himself, "I am sure that my father has forgotten.
I am going to keep on leaving my
crusts."</p>

<p>But his father had not forgotten. He was
just waiting to see if Peter would obey.</p>

<p>That noon he saw that Peter had left a
crust.</p>

<p>He said, "My son, you have not learned
to eat your crusts. And you have not
learned to obey. I must teach you."</p>

<p>Then Peter was more naughty still. He
said, "I do not like old crust. I will throw
old crust away. Then I cannot eat it."</p>

<p>He picked up the crust and jumped down
from his chair.</p>

<p>His father called, "Peter!"</p>

<p>But Peter did not stop. He ran to the
door and threw the crust out upon the
grass.</p>

<p>His father went after him. "You may
pick up your crust, Peter," said he.</p>

<p>This time Peter started to obey. He knew
that he had been very naughty. But, before
he could get to the crust, an old hen<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
ran up. She snatched it in her bill and off
she went.</p>

<img src="images/illus031.jpg" width="392" height="286" alt="" />

<p>Peter looked at his father. He was not
sure what his father would do. He almost
wished the hen had not taken the crust.</p>

<p>Father only laughed. He said, "That old
hen is a friend of yours, Peter. If it had not
been for her, you would have eaten that
crust."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Peter. "And, father, I
am sorry. I do not like to be naughty. I
will be good. I will eat my crusts now to
please you."</p>

<p>And after this he did.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Water now has turned to stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stone that I can walk upon."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One morning mother said, "Polly, will
you go to the store for me? I need a can
of corn. We must have it for dinner."</p>

<p>"May Peter go, too, mother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Peter may go, if he wishes.
Run and find him."</p>

<p>Now Polly and Peter liked to go to the
store. It belonged to their father. Sometimes
they helped him unpack goods.
Sometimes they sat still and watched the
customers.</p>

<p>Sometimes he let them play keeping store.
Once Polly had really sold some candy to
another little girl.</p>

<p>But to-day they could not stay to play.
They must get the can of corn for mother,
and come home.<span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>They went down the hill. At the railroad
tracks they stopped. They looked for
a train. They saw none, so they ran across
the tracks.</p>

<p>Then they came to the bridge. You can
find it on the map in the front of this book.</p>

<p>They stopped to look over the rail at the
water, far below.</p>

<p>"O Polly!" said Peter. "What is on
the water?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is ice, Peter. The top of the
water is frozen. See, the ice goes nearly
across the river."</p>

<p>"Ice, ice!" shouted Peter. "Now winter
is almost here. The leaves have gone. The
ice has come. Let's run and tell father."</p>

<p>The children ran to the store.</p>

<p>"Father, father," called Peter, "we have
seen ice!"</p>

<p>"So have I," said father. "Where did
you see it?"</p>

<p>"We saw it from the bridge. The river
is frozen at the sides. It is not frozen in
the middle."</p>

<p>"Yes," said father. "It freezes first at
the edges, because the water flows more
slowly there. In the middle it flows faster.<span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>"Every cold night that ice will grow. It
will soon cover the middle of the river, too.
And at the same time it will grow thicker."</p>

<p>"By and by it will be so thick that we
can walk upon it. Then it is time to learn
to skate. Perhaps you can learn this winter."</p>

<p>"When the ice is thick enough, men cut it
into blocks. What will they do with them?"</p>

<p>"Make houses of them," said Peter.</p>

<p>"O Peter, we are not Eskimos," said Polly.
"I know, father. They will put the ice into
big ice houses. They will keep it to use in
the hot summer. I saw them doing it last
winter."</p>

<p>"Right, Polly. That is where our ice
comes from in the summer."</p>

<p>"Does all the water in the river freeze,
father? Where do the fishes go? Are
they in the ice?"</p>

<p>"The ice is lighter than the water, Peter.
So it stays on top of the water. The bottom
of our river does not freeze. The fishes
are there. They do not mind the cold as
we do.</p>

<p>"Did you come to the store just to tell
me about the ice, chicks?"</p>

<p>"No, father," said Polly. "We came for<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
a can of corn. We saw the ice when we
were on the bridge."</p>

<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="394" height="213" alt="" />

<p>"Then here is the corn. Take it to
mother and tell her about the ice."</p>

<p>Off went the children. When they came
to the bridge, Peter dropped some small
stones on the ice. But it did not break.</p>

<p>"It must be thick now, Polly," said he.
"I wish we could skate."</p>

<p>"We weigh more than those stones do,
Peter. I think the cold will have to make
the ice grow more before father will let us.
And, anyway, we have no skates."</p>

<p>"Let's tell mother about that, too, Polly.
Perhaps she knows where there are some."</p>

<p>So Peter and Polly hurried up the hill to
find their mother.</p>

<h2 id="THE_THREE_GUESSES">THE THREE GUESSES</h2>

<p>"Polly and Peter," said Mr. Howe, "I
have something for you. It is something
to use in the winter, and not in the summer.
You may have three guesses."</p>

<p>"It can't be a sled," said Polly, "for we
have sleds."</p>

<p>"It can't be a coat," said Peter, "for we
have coats."</p>

<p>"And we have mittens and leggings and
overshoes, too," said Polly.</p>

<p>"It might be my pony," said Peter.</p>

<p>"No," said Polly. "It couldn't be, Peter.
We can use a pony in the summer. Let's
not guess that."</p>

<p>"Is it good to eat, father?" asked Peter.
"I am hungry now."</p>

<p>"No, Peter. And there are four of them;
two for each of you. They are hard and
shiny."</p>

<p>"Guns, guns!" shouted Peter.<span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>"One guess is gone, Peter. What would
you do with two guns?"</p>

<p>"Are they for us to wear, father?" asked
Polly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Polly, but not all the time. You
cannot wear them in the house."</p>

<p>"Then I know what they are, father. If
there are two for each of us, that is one for
each foot. Can't you guess now, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Rubber boots," shouted Peter.</p>

<p>"I think it is skates, father. And I am
glad. I have wished for some ever since
we saw the ice."</p>

<p>"You have made a good guess, Polly.
Bring me the box that is in the hall."</p>

<p>Out of the box Mr. Howe took two pairs
of shining new skates.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, goody!" cried both children,
when they saw what was in the box.</p>

<p>"We will go skating now," said father.
"Then we can try them."</p>

<p>At the edge of the river he stopped. He
put on the children's skates. Then he put
on his own.</p>

<p>"I will show you how to do it," he said.
"Then I will help you just a little."</p>

<p>He showed them how to strike out, first<span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus038a.jpg" width="396" height="290" alt="" />

<p>with one foot and then with the other. His
tracks looked like this:</p>

<img src="images/illus038b.jpg" width="396" height="64" alt="" />

<p>Then Polly tried, but her tracks looked
like this:</p>

<img src="images/illus038c.jpg" width="400" height="65" alt="" />

<p>"That is not the way, Polly," said her
father. "You are skating with your right
foot. But you are only pushing with your
left. You must skate with both. Watch
me again."<span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>Then Peter tried. His tracks looked like
this:</p>

<img src="images/illus039a.jpg" width="396" height="59" alt="" />

<p>The cross marks the place where Peter
fell down. But he did not care. He got
up and tried again.</p>

<p>Polly was doing better. So her father
took hold of her and helped her a little.</p>

<p>He said, "I wish you to learn alone.
Then you will be a good skater. If I help
you all the time, you will never be able to
skate alone."</p>

<img src="images/illus039b.jpg" width="400" height="310" alt="" />
<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>

<p>Polly said, "That is what my teacher
tells us. She says, 'I will show you how
to do it. And I will help you a little. Then
you must try for yourself.'"</p>

<p>"That is good," said father. "You must
learn to do things alone. Your teacher and
your father will not always be near."</p>

<p>Soon the skates were taken off. "We
must not stay too long the first time," said
father. "You may come again to-morrow.
You may skate every day until the snow
comes."</p>

<p>"Oh, may we, father, may we?" cried
Peter and Polly, jumping up and down.
"And when the snow comes, we can sweep
it off the ice."</p>

<p>"Maybe I shall not wish for any snow
now," said Peter. "Maybe I like skating
better."</p>

<p>"You will get the snow just the same,
my son," said father. "So you may as well
wish for it. It is sure to come."</p>

<p>"Now, good-by. We have all had a good
time. Take my skates home with you and
dry them when you dry yours. Then they
will not rust. We will bring mother the
next time we come."</p>

<h2 id="THE_FIRST_SNOWSTORM">THE FIRST SNOWSTORM</h2>

<p>One morning mother called to Peter,
"Wake up, Peter! Look out of your
window. Winter has come."</p>

<p>Peter had been dreaming about a big
snow man who chased him. He jumped out
of bed and said, "You didn't get me that
time, old snow man. I woke up too soon."</p>

<p>He ran to the window. The ground was
white. The trees were white. The air
was full of the white butterflies that Peter
likes so well.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" he shouted. "I must go out
to play! I must go out to play!"</p>

<p>"Not until you are dressed, Peter," said
mother. "Then you must have breakfast.
After that you may go out."<span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>At breakfast father said, "It has snowed
a foot since dark yesterday. How many
inches is that, Polly?"</p>

<p>"It is twelve inches, father. Do you think
this snow has come to stay? Or will it
melt away?"</p>

<p>"I think that it will stay, Polly. It is
time for sleighing."</p>

<p>Peter and Polly put on their coats and
caps, their leggings, overshoes, and mittens.
Then they were ready to go out.</p>

<p>At first Peter ran about in the yard. He
kicked up the snow as he ran. It flew all
over him.</p>

<p>"Polly, Polly!" he called. "I am a snow
man now. I shall chase you as the one in
my dream chased me."</p>

<p>He ran after her. Just as he caught her,
she slipped. Down they both went. They
were covered from head to foot with snow.</p>

<p>"Now we are both snow men," said Polly.
"Let's go and shake the little trees."</p>

<p>These were two fir trees. They were at
the side of the house. Polly took hold of
the end of a low branch. Peter stood under
the tree, while Polly shook it. Down came
a shower of snow.<span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>Then Polly stood under the other, while
Peter shook that. Down came another
shower of snow. Some of this went
into Polly's neck. But Polly did not
care.</p>

<p>"Now we will show grandmother how
white we are," she said.</p>

<p>Grandmother heard them coming. She
went out on the piazza.</p>

<img src="images/illus043.jpg" width="398" height="420" alt="" />
<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>

<p>She said, "I see two snow men. I cannot
ask them in. Snow men would melt
near the fire. Then they would be nothing
but water."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, grandmother, they would be
Peter and Polly," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter! Why, Polly! Is this
really you? I have no spectacles on, this
morning. Where are your sleds?"</p>

<p>"In the barn, in the barn!" shouted Peter.
"We could not wait for them."</p>

<p>"See the posts of your fence, grandmother,"
said Polly. "They all have on
tall white caps."</p>

<p>"So they have, Polly. And how clean
the snow caps are. How clean the snow
makes everything. We are all glad to have
it, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"I am, I am!" shouted Peter. "Winter
has come, winter has come! Good-by,
grandmother. I must go and play."</p>

<p>"Good-by," called grandmother. "Come
down to dinner, if mother will let you. We
will have sugar on snow."</p>

<p>"She will let us," called Peter. "I
know she will. And I will get the pan
of snow for the sugar."</p>

<h2 id="THE_STAR_SNOWFLAKE">THE STAR SNOWFLAKE</h2>

<p>All that day Peter and Polly played in
the snow. All day Peter's white butterflies
fell. Down they came out of the air, softly
and silently.</p>

<p>Peter liked to stand and look up into the
sky. He liked to feel the soft flakes light
upon his face. He liked to see them on his
coat sleeve.</p>

<p>Polly said, "Aren't the flakes pretty, Peter?
They are little stars. The perfect ones have
six points. The Story Lady told me a story
about a star snowflake. I will tell it to you.</p>

<p>"Once a little water fairy lived in our
brook, back of grandmother's house. One
day she was very, very naughty. She did
not wish to go up into the air. She did not<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
wish to be part of a cloud. She wished to
stay in the brook.</p>

<p>"Her father said, 'You must go. And I
shall have you punished for being so naughty.
I shall have Jack Frost change you into a
snowflake.'</p>

<p>"Jack Frost came one day to change the
cloud into snowflakes. He saw how sorry
the water fairy was because she had been so
naughty.</p>

<p>"So he said, 'You know that I have to
make all snowflakes like stars. Some of
them are very pretty. I will change you
into the prettiest star snowflake that I know.'</p>

<p>"'And when you melt,' said Jack Frost,
'you will be a water fairy again. You will
always be good then, won't you?'</p>

<p>"So he changed her into a beautiful star
snowflake. I have seen her picture. The
Story Lady showed it to me."</p>

<p>"Let's find her," said Peter. "Then
let's show her to the Story Lady. That
will be better than the picture."</p>

<p>So the children looked and looked. They
found many stars. But Polly was not sure
that any one of them was the right one.</p>

<p>At last Peter found the most beautiful star<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
of all. "This is the water fairy, this is the
water fairy!" he cried.</p>

<p>And Polly said, "It does look like the
picture. So let's go and show it to the
Story Lady."</p>

<p>Down they went to her house and into
the kitchen. There was the Story Lady,
washing dishes.</p>

<p>"O Story Lady," said Peter. "I have the
water fairy on my arm! She is changed
into a star. See her!"</p>

<p>But when the Story Lady looked, there
was no star snowflake.</p>

<p>"She has gone," said Peter. "That is
too bad." And he looked ready to cry.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Peter," said the Story Lady.
"She has gone. But don't you think that
she is happy to be just a water fairy again?
She likes that better, you know. You must
be glad that you found her and helped her
melt."</p>

<p>"I am glad," said Peter. "But it was
only a 'Once upon a time' story, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Of course it was, Peter. But don't you
know that all snowflakes are water fairies?
Now run along and play with those that are
left."</p>

<h2 id="HOW_PETER_HELPED_GRANDMOTHER">HOW PETER HELPED GRANDMOTHER</h2>

<p>Grandmother was getting ready for
Thanksgiving. Peter and Polly and father
and mother were going to her house on
that day.</p>

<p>So grandmother was making mince pies.
She was making other things, too. One
was fruit cake.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly were down at grandmother's,
helping. At least, Polly was
helping and Peter was hindering.</p>

<p>He seemed bound to stand just where
grandmother wished to walk. He spilled
a cup of milk on the table. After he had
wiped it up, he upset some flour.</p>

<p>But he did not mean to hinder.<span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>Polly watched her grandmother make
the pies. She watched her roll the pie
crust thin and trim it to the size of the
plate.</p>

<p>She said, "If I had some dough, I am
sure I could do that."</p>

<p>Her grandmother gave her some and a
little plate. Polly rubbed the plate with
melted butter. Then she rolled out the
dough and put it on the plate.</p>

<p>"That is very good, Polly. Now we will
fill our pies. Here is the mincemeat."</p>

<p>Polly tried to make her little pie look like
grandmother's large one.</p>

<p>"Next we must put on the covers," said
grandmother. "Roll yours out like mine."</p>

<p>She had Polly stick a knife through her
cover in four places. Ask your mother
why she did this.</p>

<p>Then she helped Polly put on her cover,
for that was quite hard to do. Last of
all she showed her how to pinch together
the edges.</p>

<p>"Now," said grandmother, "we will bake
our pies. What shall you do with yours?"</p>

<p>"I should like to take it home to show
mother and father. May I?"<span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus050.jpg" width="398" height="388" alt="" />

<p>"Why, to be sure. They ought to have
a bite of your first pie. Please, Peter, carry
this pail of sugar into the pantry for me.
I do not need it any more."</p>

<p>The pies were baked brown. As soon as
hers was cool enough, Polly carried it up
the hill to mother.</p>

<p>"See, mother," she said, "I can cook
now. Grandmother let me make a pie. It
is for you and father."<span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>"How good it looks, Polly! We will
try it for dinner. You have done this
well. I see that I must begin to teach you
to cook.</p>

<p>"Bread comes first. The next time I
sponge bread, you may try. Your first
good loaf you may take to grandmother."</p>

<p>"Oh, may I, mother? I want to learn
to cook. Then I can cook for you and
father. I watched grandmother all the
morning. I helped her, too."</p>

<p>"So did I help grandmother," said Peter.</p>

<p>"O Peter, what did you do to help?"
asked Polly. "You spilled the milk and
then you spilled the flour. That isn't helping
much."</p>

<p>"I did help," said Peter. "I helped all
the morning. I worked very hard."</p>

<p>"I am sure that you meant to, Peter,"
said mother. "But tell me what you
did."</p>

<p>"Why," said Peter, "why, I carried away
the pail of sugar."</p>

<p>Polly laughed, but mother said, "That
was kind, Peter. And you know that you
always help by being a good boy. So I
really think that you are right."</p>

<h2 id="THE_SNOW_MAN">THE SNOW MAN</h2>

<p>"Let's make a snow man this morning.
Will you, Peter? The snow is just right
for big balls."</p>

<p>"Then we will," said Peter. "But let's
get Tim to help us."</p>

<p>Tim is Peter's playmate. He lives on a
farm. His house is farther up the hill.
Look for it on the map in the front of this
book.</p>

<p>Soon Tim was down at Peter's. His big
dog Collie was with him. Wag-wag and
Collie are friends. They often play together.</p>

<p>The three children began to roll snowballs.
Polly's grew very large. The boys
had to help her with it. They pushed it
over and over. At last it was quite near
the edge of the bank.</p>

<p>"One more push," said Polly. "Then it
will be just right. People can see the man
from the road."<span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>But that push was too much. Over the
edge of the bank the big ball rolled.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop, stop!" cried Peter. "Do not
run away. We will make you into a good
snow man."</p>

<p>But the ball did not stop. It rolled
against Tim. It knocked him flat. Peter
and Polly fell down the bank after it. At
last it smashed itself against the fence.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Polly. "We can
make another. Do not let the next one
knock you down, Tim."</p>

<p>"Old snowball ran over me," said Tim.
"But I do not care. He smashed himself."</p>

<p>Another big ball was made. It was rolled
into place. Then smaller ones were lifted
on it. These were for the body.</p>

<p>At last the head was ready. Polly stood
in a chair. She stuck the head on the body.
She made eyes, a nose, and a mouth with
small sticks.</p>

<p>She put an old hat on the head. She
put a branch under the arm.</p>

<p>Then she said, "We will name you White
Giant. You may take care of our house at
night. In the daytime you may play with
us. Will you, old Giant?"<span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>Polly did not think that the snow man
could talk. But just then she heard some
one say, "Of course I will play with you,
Polly."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! Has he come alive?" cried
Peter. "Can he chase me? I do not wish
him to do that." And he ran behind Polly.</p>

<p>"I cannot chase you, Peter," the snow
man seemed to say. "I cannot move at
all in the daytime. But at night you should
see me."</p>

<p>"I saw you the other night in a dream,"
said Peter. "I did not like you. You
chased me."</p>

<p>"I will never do that again, Peter. So
you must not be afraid of me."</p>

<p>Just then Tim cried out, "Look, look!"
And there behind a tree was Peter's father.</p>

<p>Polly laughed. "I know now that the
snow man did not talk," she said. "At first
I thought he did. It was you, wasn't it,
father?"</p>

<p>"Why do you think so, Polly? You
didn't see me. Did it sound like me?"</p>

<p>"No, it did not, father," said Peter.
"And I think it was the snow man. I
am going to watch him to-night and see."</p>

<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>

<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="400" height="288" alt="" />

<p>"Why don't you?" asked father. "I
should like to know about it. You tell
me when you find out. Where are your
mittens, Tim? Aren't your hands cold?"</p>

<p>"I've lost them. And Peter has lost one
of his red ones. We can't find them at all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are under the snow. The
sun will help you find them by and by.
Peter, run in and tell mother. She will get
some mittens for you and Tim to wear.</p>

<p>"When you come back, bring the old
broom. That is better than the branch for
your snow man. If you watch to-night,
you may see what he does with it."</p>

<h2 id="PETERS_DREAM">PETER'S DREAM</h2>

<p>At bedtime Peter said, "I want to sit up.
I am going to watch the snow man."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked mother.</p>

<p>"I heard him speak," said Peter. "He
said he would not chase me. He said I
ought to see him at night. He can move
then."</p>

<p>"Very well," said mother. "But you
might get into your bed. You can watch
him from your window."</p>

<p>"I did not think of that, mother. I will
go now."</p>

<p>Soon Peter was in bed. By sitting up, he
could see the snow man. His window was
wide open. But Peter had on thick night
clothes. He did not feel the cold.</p>

<p>The moon was bright. Peter thought of
his friend, the Fairy Bird. He wished the
Bird would come again and take him to the
moon.<span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>All at once he rubbed his eyes. Where
was the snow man? He looked again.
The snow man was gone!</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" said Peter to himself. "I've
lost him. That's too bad. Now I shall not
see anything."</p>

<p>But just then the door opened softly.
Peter saw something white coming into his
room. It was the snow man!</p>

<p>Peter was so surprised that he nearly
jumped out of bed. He was frightened, too.
He called, "Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>"Sh, sh, sh!" said the snow man. "You'll
wake every one in the house. I came up
here to please you. I don't care to see any
one else.</p>

<p>"It was hard work climbing the stairs.
You children didn't make me very good
legs; nor very good arms, either, I must
say. I have no feet and no hands.</p>

<p>"My hat came off when I broke myself
away from the snow. But, without hands,
I couldn't put it back on my head.</p>

<p>"I do wish that you would make me
better next time. You can, if you try. But
I'm thankful you gave me eyes and a mouth,
too. I like to see and I like to talk."<span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>"Don't you like to eat?" asked Peter.
"What do you eat? Oh, dear! I'm afraid
you eat little boys like me."</p>

<p>The snow man began to shake. Bits of
snow dropped on the floor.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter, I believe you are afraid of
me. You needn't be. You'll laugh, too,
when I tell you what I do eat. Sticks and
twigs and leaves that I pick up when you
are rolling me.</p>

<p>"Best of all I like mittens. I don't get
very many. But I ate yours and Tim's this
morning. They were good. I like red ones
best. And I had only one red mitten."</p>

<img src="images/illus058.jpg" width="394" height="292" alt="" />
<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>

<p>Then Peter did laugh. "What queer
things to eat," he said. "And how funny
you look when you laugh. You shake, but
you do not laugh with your mouth."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the snow man. "That's all
because of Polly. You see, she made my
mouth with a horrid straight stick. I can't
bend it at all."</p>

<p>"You make me very cold," said Peter.
"You are so white. I want my mother to
come and tuck me up."</p>

<p>"I will try," the snow man said. And,
with his snowy arms, he tried to pull up
the bedclothes. One arm slipped and hit
Peter's neck. Peter was so surprised that
he screamed.</p>

<p>In just a minute mother ran in. "What
is it, dear?" she asked.</p>

<p>Peter could only say, "The snow man,
the snow man! He has been up here!"</p>

<p>"He's out in the yard, dear. I can see
him. And he has lost his hat. The wind
must have blown it off. It has been raining
hard. The rain has come in at the window.
It is wet on the floor."</p>

<p>"He didn't have his hat up here," said
Peter. "He dropped it when he started.<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
He couldn't put it on. And he made those
spots on the floor. It was not the rain.
Pieces of snow dropped off him when he
laughed."</p>

<p>Mother only said, "I'll tuck you up again,
Peter. We can see about it in the morning.
Now good night."</p>

<img src="images/illus060.jpg" width="396" height="213" alt="" />

<p>In the morning the rain had stopped.
The children went to look at the snow man.
He had grown much smaller in the night.
There was a crack near the bottom of his
legs.</p>

<p>"He did walk, he did, I know he did!"
cried Peter. "That's what made the crack.
And, O Polly, look at this!"</p>

<p>Sticking out of the snow man's stomach
was the end of a red mitten!</p>

<h2 id="CUTTING_THE_CHRISTMAS_TREE">CUTTING THE CHRISTMAS TREE</h2>

<p>It was nearly Christmas. Peter could
hardly wait for the day to come.</p>

<p>He kept saying, "Mother, will it be
Christmas to-morrow? Mother, will it be
Christmas to-morrow?"</p>

<p>At last father said, "Do you want Christmas
before I get the tree?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peter. "But will you ever
get it?"</p>

<p>"I will to-day. You and Polly may go
with me. We will choose the prettiest fir
tree we can find. Put on your things, and
we will start now."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, goody!" cried Peter, jumping
up and down. "Now I know that Christmas
is almost here."</p>

<p>"It will be here to-morrow," said father.
"Run and tell Polly."</p>

<p>They went through the field back of the<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
house. They climbed over the stone-wall
post office. Polly looked into some of the
boxes for mail.</p>

<p>She said, "Father, one day Peter told me
that he had a pony in his post-office box."</p>

<p>"It must have been a very large box,
Polly. We do not have such large ones at
the store. Which is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I didn't have it in my
box," said Peter. "I think I shall get it on
the tree. It will be up in the tiptop."</p>

<p>"Then we must find a strong tree, my
boy. Can you see one you like?"</p>

<p>"That one," said Peter.</p>

<p>Father laughed. "That is a strong tree.
But it is too tall. We should have to cut a
hole in the ceiling to stand it up. Find a
smaller one."</p>

<p>"There is a good tree, father. See how
pretty it is. It looks like our little firs at
home."</p>

<p>"I believe that is just right for us, Polly.
I will cut it down. Please hold my coat."</p>

<p>Father swung his ax. He gave three
sharp blows. All at once there was a chatter
overhead.</p>

<p>In the next tree a gray squirrel was running<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
up a large branch. He was scolding
with all his might. His tail was jerking.
He looked very cross.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow," said father, "did I disturb
you? I am sorry. Go back to sleep.
We will not take your tree."</p>

<p>"His is too bare, isn't it, father? The
leaves have all gone. We must have a fir
tree for ours. It has queer leaves. But
they do not fall off in the winter."</p>

<p>"That is why we call such trees evergreens,
Polly. They are always green.
Pine trees are evergreens, too. Their
needles are longer than fir needles."</p>

<img src="images/illus063.jpg" width="394" height="301" alt="" />
<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>

<p>"I think that is one of our squirrels," said
Peter. "He took our nuts, Polly. I wonder
where he put them."</p>

<p>"He thought they were his," said Polly.
"He needed them."</p>

<p>Soon father had cut down the fir. He put
it over his shoulder. The end dragged on
the snow.</p>

<p>"Now we are ready for home," he said.
"To-night mother and I will dress this tree.
To-morrow you may see it."</p>

<p>"Have you really a dress for it?" asked
Peter. "I hope it is red. Who made it?"</p>

<p>"O Peter, how silly you are! Father
means dress it up with candy bags and
popped corn and presents."</p>

<p>"I know now," said Peter. "Ponies and
guns and things."</p>

<p>"See the snow sparkle, children. The sun
makes it do that. Look at the blue sky.
Doesn't the air feel good to you?"</p>

<p>"It makes me feel like running," said
Polly.</p>

<p>"Then run along, chicks. You will get
home first. Tell mother that the Christmas
tree is really coming. You may pop the
corn this afternoon."</p>

<h2 id="THE_GIVE-AWAY_BOX">THE GIVE-AWAY BOX</h2>

<p>When Peter and Polly got home, they
ran into the house.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother!" they shouted. "The
Christmas tree is coming. Father has it."</p>

<p>"Why, mother," said Polly, "what makes
the house smell so sweet? It smells just
like the woods."</p>

<p>"It is the green wreaths, Polly. I have
them in all the rooms. There is one on the
front door, too. These wreaths smell better
than the ones that we buy. You may help
me make the rest of them. We need more."</p>

<p>So the children went into the kitchen. On
a table were pieces of evergreen boughs.</p>

<p>They helped their mother twist the pieces
into circles. On each circle she wound
many small twigs. When done, the
wreaths were firm and thick and green.</p>

<p>"How good it does smell, mother. I like
Christmas smells. But see my hands."<span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>"That is the pitch from the greens,
Polly. Just rub on a little butter. It will
take off the pitch. Then wash your hands
in warm water. I will clean up the rest
of the greens. When this is done, we will
pop our corn."</p>

<p>That was always fun. Polly liked to
shake the popper. She liked to see the
white kernels of corn hop up and down.
She liked the good smell, too.</p>

<p>Soon two large panfuls were popped.
Then came another task. The corn must
be strung. Polly and Peter both helped.
But, of course, mother could string faster
than they. She told them stories while
they worked.</p>

<p>"When I was a little girl," said mother,
"we did not have a Christmas tree. Instead,
we hung up our stockings. We
hung them near the fireplace. We thought
Santa Claus could reach them better there.</p>

<p>"I was the smallest in our family. So
my stocking was the smallest. My presents
would never go into my stocking. This
used to tease me.</p>

<p>"My dear grandmother found it out.
One day she said to me, 'I am going to<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
knit you a new red stocking. It is not to
wear. It is for you to hang up.'</p>

<p>"And the very next Christmas, what do
you think? She had knit me a stocking as
long as I was tall! How pleased I was to
hang it up!</p>

<p>"Now, children, the Give-away Box is
ready. You may choose your things to
give away."</p>

<p>On the floor in the dining room there
was a large box. It was filled with games,
dolls, bags of candy and popped corn, and
many other things.</p>

<p>These were for Peter and Polly to give
away. They would make other children
happy. And that would make Peter and
Polly happy, too.</p>

<p>Peter chose a jumping jack for Tim.
Polly chose to give him a whistle.</p>

<p>"He cannot whistle with his mouth yet,"
she said. "Perhaps Collie will come for
this whistle."</p>

<p>When Polly was out of the room, Peter
chose a present for her. It was the prettiest
doll that he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Polly chose a train of cars for Peter.
But he did not know that.<span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus068.jpg" width="396" height="337" alt="" />

<p>"We can give this candlestick to Mrs.
White," said Polly. "She gave us back
our Jack-o'-lanterns. I think she would
like it."</p>

<p>Mother said, "Why don't you give the
hot water bag to grandmother? Her bag
leaks."</p>

<p>"Oh, we will, we will!" cried both children.</p>

<p>"Farmer Brown is our friend," said
Polly. "He showed us his sheep. Mrs.
Brown is our friend, too. She gave us a<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
party last summer. The lambs came to it.
It was on her steps. Let us give them two
wreaths."</p>

<p>"There is my teacher," said Peter. "I
will give her these marbles."</p>

<p>Polly said, "Your teacher! You don't go
to school, Peter."</p>

<p>"I did one day," said Peter. "I like her.
She was good to me. She is my teacher.
I don't care what you say."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, chicks," said
mother. "I'm afraid she hasn't a pocket
for the marbles. Why not give her the
box of handkerchiefs?"</p>

<p>Before long the Give-away Box was
empty. The presents were tied up. Every
friend in the village had been remembered.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly were tired. They were
glad when it was bedtime.</p>

<p>As mother tucked her up, Polly said, "I
like the Give-away Box. It is fun. It is
as much fun as it is to get things. You
gave it to us, mother. You give us everything."</p>

<p>"Father, too," said mother. "And it
makes fathers and mothers happy to do
that."</p>

<h2 id="CHRISTMAS_MORNING">CHRISTMAS MORNING</h2>

<p>Early Christmas morning Peter awoke.
He heard a noise in mother's room. So
he knew that he might get up.</p>

<p>He pushed open the door. "Merry
Christmas! Merry Christmas!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas," said mother, hugging
him tightly.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas," said father, tossing
him up into the air. "Did you see Santa
Claus last night?"</p>

<p>Just then Polly ran in. "Oh, oh, it is
Christmas!" she cried. "Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas! See what I found in my
bed."</p>

<p>It was a box of animal crackers. They
were all sheep.</p>

<p>"O father! You did it for a joke. You
know I do not like mutton."<span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>Peter ran to look in his room. He
thought a joke might be there, too.</p>

<p>"See, see!" he shouted. "I have found
a letter box. That is not a joke."</p>

<p>"Look inside," said father.</p>

<p>Peter looked. There he saw a very small
pony. It was made of cloth. On its back
it had a cloth monkey.</p>

<p>"A joke, a joke!" cried Polly. "Your
pony came in your letter box after all."</p>

<p>There were to be no more presents until
after breakfast. So the children dressed
quickly.</p>

<p>It was hard for them to eat anything.</p>

<p>At last Polly said, "I cannot wait another
second. I will eat my breakfast with my
dinner. Here comes grandmother. Now
may we open the door and see the tree?"</p>

<p>"In just a minute," said father. "You
say 'Merry Christmas' to grandmother. I
have one last thing for the tree. You may
come in when I call." And out he ran.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it is," said Polly. "I
can hear him coming back through the side
door."</p>

<p>Then grandmother came in, and Polly
forgot to wonder any more.<span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>At last they heard father shout, "Come!"</p>

<p>Polly opened the door, and the children
rushed in.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" said Polly.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" said Peter.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful tree they had never before
seen. It was hung with strings of
popped corn and red cranberries. It was
covered with colored balls and big gold
stars. Over it was white, shiny stuff that
looked like snow.</p>

<p>It had candy bags and oranges. At the
top, there was a doll with wings. And
there were many boxes and packages.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" said both children
again.</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" asked mother.</p>

<p>"I never saw anything so pretty," said
Polly. "Is that a fairy at the top?"</p>

<p>"I think it is Santa Claus's little girl,"
said Peter. "I should like to have her for
my own."</p>

<p>"Should you rather have that than anything
else here?" asked father.</p>

<p>"I think so, father. May I?"</p>

<p>"Walk around the tree and see if you
are sure, my son."<span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus073.jpg" width="398" height="476" alt="" />

<p>Peter did as he was told. He had not
taken many steps when he jumped back
with a cry.</p>

<p>"What is it? What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Polly ran forward, and what do you
think she saw?<span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>On the other side of the tree something
moved. Polly saw two large eyes, two long
ears, a brown head, and then she knew that
it was a pony.</p>

<p>"Peter, Peter!" she cried, "here is the
pony! It is on the Christmas tree! O
Peter, Peter, Peter!"</p>

<p>"Lead her out," said father. "She will
come with you. She likes children."</p>

<p>So Polly took hold of the little strap. And
the pony walked out into the room after her.</p>

<p>"Her name is Brownie," said father.
"She is grandmother's present to you and
Peter. She is half yours and half Peter's."</p>

<p>"O grandmother!" cried Polly. "I thank
you now, but I will thank you better by and
by."</p>

<p>"Which half is mine, grandmother?"
asked Peter.</p>

<p>"Half of both halves," said grandmother.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Peter. "I love both her
halves. And I love you, too. And I love
the tree, and Christmas, and everybody."</p>

<p>"And so you should," said father. "Come
now, we will take Brownie to her stable.
Then you may get the presents off the tree."</p>

<h2 id="THE_SNOW_HOUSE">THE SNOW HOUSE</h2>

<p>One day there was a heavy snowstorm.
At the same time the wind blew. It heaped
the snow over the road in front of Polly's
house.</p>

<p>The snow was so deep that horses could
not walk through. Men had to dig the
road out.</p>

<p>Mr. Howe helped to do this. Peter and
Polly watched the work. They thought it
great fun.</p>

<p>The men threw the snow by the side of
the road. Soon the piles were very high.
They were twice as high as Polly could
reach.</p>

<p>A few days after this Polly said, "I know
what we can do."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"Let's play Eskimos."</p>

<p>"How do you play it?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"Well," said Polly, "first we must make<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
a snow house. Then we can think of other
things to do."</p>

<img src="images/illus076.jpg" width="398" height="286" alt="" />

<p>"We can't," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Can't what?" asked Polly. "Can't
think of things to do? I can, if you can't."</p>

<p>"No," said Peter, "we can't make a
snow house. We tried. It tumbled down.
Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"I've thought how to do it, Peter.
Come on. I will show you."</p>

<p>Polly took Peter to the great pile of
snow by the side of the road.</p>

<p>"There is our house," she said. "It is
all made for us."<span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>"That isn't any house, Polly. I think I
won't play with you to-day. You tease me.
I am going to see Tim. Good-by."</p>

<p>"O Peter! Wait, wait! I won't tease.
I will tell you about it now. That is our
house really and truly. But it is just the
outside.</p>

<p>"We must make a hole in the pile for a
door. Then we must dig out the inside.
Can't we do that, Peter?"</p>

<p>Peter said, "Oh, yes. We can do that.
I see about it now. I will help. We can
dig very well.</p>

<img src="images/illus077.jpg" width="398" height="288" alt="" />

<p>"We dug our cyclone hole last summer.<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
Perhaps we shall find another box with
silver dollars in it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall not, too," said Polly.
"I don't expect to find things in the snow.
People hide their gold and silver in the
ground.</p>

<p>"The ground does not melt. Snow does.
So it would not hide their gold and silver
very long."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't the ground melt, Polly?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. You ask father.
Snow melts because it is made of water."</p>

<p>"Butter melts, sugar melts," said Peter.
"They are not made of water. I wish to
know why the ground does not melt, too.
I wish to know now."</p>

<p>"Peter, can't you stop asking questions
and go to work? See, first we must dig a
path here. Then we will begin our door."</p>

<p>It took a long time to dig the path. But
at last it was finished. Then they made a
hole. It went straight into the side of the
big snow pile. That was for the door.</p>

<p>"Now we must hollow out a place," said
Polly. "It will be our room. We must
make it large. We shall sleep there and
eat there and live there. That is the way<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
the Eskimos do. I read it in a book at
school."</p>

<p>"I'd rather live in a house," said Peter.
"Let's live in the house and play out here."</p>

<p>"Then we will," said Polly. "It would
be cold here anyway. I should think
Eskimos would freeze in snow houses. But
they do not."</p>

<p>The next day the children scraped out
more snow, and the next and the next. At
last they had made quite a large room.</p>

<p>It was nearly round. The floor was
packed hard. The white walls were smooth.
Polly could stand up straight in the middle.</p>

<p>Mother gave them an old rug for the floor.</p>

<p>She said, "Eskimos have fur rugs. You
must play that this is bearskin."</p>

<p>Father said, "Do you know what Eskimos
call a snow house? It is igloo. Perhaps
some day I will try to crawl into your igloo.
I should like to see it."</p>

<p>"Oh, do, father. Then we will have a
party. It is quite warm inside. But we
can make the door bigger for you."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," said father.
"Perhaps I can get a fairy to shrink me.
We shall see."</p>

<h2 id="THE_FALL_OF_THE_IGLOO">THE FALL OF THE IGLOO</h2>

<p>For many days the children played in
their igloo. More snow fell. They dug it
out of the path. Then they could get to
the door.</p>

<p>"It only makes our house taller," said
Polly. "It does not hurt the inside. I do
not care how much snow comes on top of
it."</p>

<p>"You may care some day," said father.
"Snow is heavy. After a while it may
break down your roof."</p>

<p>"What if we are inside when the roof
breaks, Peter? The snow will get down
our necks."</p>

<p>"It will do more," said father. "It will
bury you."</p>

<p>"Will it hurt us, father?"</p>

<p>"I think not. But you will look like
snow men afterward."</p>

<p>One day Tim was playing with Peter and
Polly. They were in the igloo. Collie was
outside playing with Wag-wag.<span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>Wag-wag could go into the igloo. But
the children did not like to have Collie
there. He was so large that he took up too
much room.</p>

<p>Polly was the mother Eskimo. Peter
was the father Eskimo. Tim was the little
boy Eskimo.</p>

<p><i>Mother Eskimo.</i> "I think we need some
meat. We need a seal. I can use its skin.
I will make boots of it."</p>

<p><i>Father Eskimo.</i> "I killed a bear yesterday.
Use the bearskin for boots."</p>

<p><i>Mother Eskimo.</i> "Oh, no. That would
not make good boots. I need sealskin for
them. Besides I wish to use the bearskin
to make some trousers. I must have new
ones."</p>

<img src="images/illus081.jpg" width="394" height="217" alt="" />
<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>

<p>"O Polly," said Peter, "women do not
wear trousers."</p>

<p>"Eskimo women do, Peter. Now you go
and catch me a seal."</p>

<p><i>Father Eskimo.</i> "But it is cold. I may
have to watch many hours for a seal. I must
sit very still beside his hole in the ice. If I
move, he will not come up there to breathe.
Perhaps I shall freeze, sitting so still."</p>

<p><i>Mother Eskimo.</i> "No, you will not. Do
I not make you good fur clothes? Do I
not sew them with my good bone needle?
They will keep you warm."</p>

<p><i>Father Eskimo.</i> "Yes, but don't I have
to get the fur for them? That is harder
than making the clothes."</p>

<p><i>Mother Eskimo.</i> "I am not so sure that
it is. Should you like to scrape the skins
to clean them? Should you like to chew
them to make them soft?"</p>

<p><i>Father Eskimo.</i> "No, I should rather
hunt than chew skins. So I will go now."</p>

<p>Father Eskimo crawled out of the igloo.
He called to the dogs.</p>

<p>"Come here, dogs. You must drag my
sledge. I am going out to catch a seal.
You must draw it home on the sledge."<span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>The dogs were jumping up and down and
playing with each other. They did not
know that they were Eskimo dogs.</p>

<p>Peter could not get them. He grew quite
cross. He crawled back into the igloo.</p>

<p>"I cannot catch the dogs," he said. "I
shall not go hunting. I shall not play
Eskimo any more to-day."</p>

<p>Polly started to speak. But instead
she screamed. Something was happening.
What were the dogs doing? Were they on
the top of the igloo?</p>

<p>The roof was breaking. She could see
the leg of one dog sticking through. Then
something fell on the children.</p>

<p>It was the snow roof. It was also two
dogs. Collie and Wag-wag had broken
down the igloo.</p>

<p>Father was just coming home. How he
laughed when he saw the children and the
dogs. He pulled them out from under the
snow.</p>

<p>He said, "Aren't you glad you are not
real Eskimos? Aren't you glad you live in
a strong house? Let's all go in and see
what mother is cooking for supper. It will
not be seal meat. Tim must come, too."</p>

<h2 id="PULLING_PETERS_TOOTH">PULLING PETER'S TOOTH</h2>

<p>Peter had a loose tooth. It was a lower
front tooth. It was his first loose tooth.
He had always wanted one.</p>

<p>When Polly's teeth became loose, he
would feel of his.</p>

<p>He would say, "I wish I could wiggle
mine, too. I wish I could pull mine out."</p>

<p>Mother said, "You are not yet old
enough to lose your teeth. I am glad that
you are not. Why do you wish to have a
loose tooth?"</p>

<p>"Because they are nice to wiggle," said
Peter. "Because Polly is faster than I am.
She has had four. I like the holes in her
face, too. She can make a funny noise
through them. It is a whistle."<span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>"Your turn will come by and by," said
mother. "I suppose you will lose your
upper front teeth first."</p>

<p>But it happened one day that Peter fell
down. He bumped his nose. He also cut
his lip on a tooth.</p>

<p>He must have bumped that tooth quite
hard, for it became loose. Peter was much
pleased.</p>

<p>"I should let it alone," said mother.
"Perhaps it will grow tight again."</p>

<p>But Peter could not seem to let it alone.
He wiggled it with his tongue. He wiggled
it with his fingers. At last he made it very
loose.</p>

<p>Then he said, "Polly, I must pull my
tooth."</p>

<p>"Oh, let it come out," said Polly. "Two
of mine did."</p>

<p>"No," said Peter. "I shall pull it. You
pulled one of yours with your fingers. I
shall do that."</p>

<p>But the loose tooth would not come out.</p>

<p>"It will not pull," said Peter. "I shall put
a string on it. I shall tie the end of the string
to the door. Then I shall shut the door hard.
It will pull my tooth. You did that."<span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Polly. "That was fun.
But I know a better way now. I will
show it to you."</p>

<p>She took a flatiron. She tied a string to
it. She set it on the kitchen table. Then
she tied the other end of the string to
Peter's loose tooth.</p>

<p>She said, "This string is too short to
reach the floor. You push the flatiron off
the table. It will fall down and jerk out
your tooth."</p>

<p>"Shall I now?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"Yes, now."</p>

<p>So Peter pushed the flatiron. But Polly
had not been right. The string was too
long. It reached to the floor.</p>

<p>Down went the flatiron, bang! It landed
on the edge of Peter's boot. It landed on
the edge of Peter's toe, too. It hurt him, but
not much. And the tooth did not come out.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" cried Peter. "It hurt my
foot, it hurt my foot! It didn't pull out
my tooth at all." And he started to jump
up and down.</p>

<p>The very first jump surprised him.
Something pulled at his mouth and then
seemed to let go.<span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus087.jpg" width="398" height="319" alt="" />

<p>It was the string around his tooth. He
had jumped up far enough to pull the tooth
out himself.</p>

<p>How Polly did laugh when she saw this!</p>

<p>Peter cried, "It's out, it's out! We have
found a new way! I found it!" And he
got down on the floor to pick up his tooth.</p>

<p>"I am going to save it to plant in my
garden," he said.</p>

<p>"To plant!" said Polly. "What for?"</p>

<p>"So I shall have more," said Peter.</p>

<p>Then Polly laughed again. She ran to
tell mother about Peter's garden.</p>

<h2 id="DRIVING_WITH_FATHER">DRIVING WITH FATHER</h2>

<p>One morning father said, "I am going to
Large Village to-day. You children may
have a ride. You may go as far as Farmer
Brown's. I will leave you there."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, goody!" cried Polly.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, goody!" cried Peter.</p>

<p>"You are to stay to dinner. I shall have
my dinner at Large Village. Run and get
ready."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" cried both children at once.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown lived two and one half
miles away. You must follow the road
past Mr. Howe's store to find his house.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly liked to go there. They
liked to see his horses, cows, sheep, pigs,
and hens.</p>

<p>"We can see the sheep," said Polly.
"They will not be in the pasture. The snow
has covered the grass. Their wool will be
thicker now than it was last summer."<span class="pagenum">[89]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus089.jpg" width="396" height="240" alt="" />

<p>"We can see the pigs," said Peter. "Perhaps
they will grunt at us."</p>

<p>They drove to the farm in a low sled.
When they were out of the village, Mr. Howe
stopped.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to ride on the runners?"
he asked.</p>

<p>This was a great treat. Peter and Polly
could never "catch rides" on people's sleds.
Some of the other children were allowed to
do this. But father showed Peter and Polly
how they might get hurt.</p>

<p>He said, "If you 'catch rides,' I shall
worry. I shall worry all the time. So I ask
you not to do it. When you drive with me,
you may 'catch rides' all you please."<span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>So, on the way to Farmer Brown's, he
drove slowly. And the children jumped on
and off the sled at any time they wished.
It was fun.</p>

<p>The road followed the river all the way.
But the river could not sing now. It was
covered with ice.</p>

<p>They passed through thick woods. Many
of the trees were cedar. They are evergreens.
So they had not lost their leaves.</p>

<p>"Look there," said father, stopping the
horse.</p>

<p>On one tree were many little birds. They
looked black and gray. They were hopping
about from twig to twig. They were calling,
"Chick-a-dee, chick-a-dee."</p>

<p>"I know them," said Polly. "They are
saying their own names over and over. They
are getting their breakfast. Aren't they cold
at night, father? Where do they sleep? I
wish they would come to our house."</p>

<p>"I hope they sleep in some old hole, Polly.
Then they can keep one another warm. Perhaps
they rent part of a woodpecker's hole
for the winter.</p>

<p>"We must put out some food for the birds
to-morrow. Do not let me forget."<span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>At last Mr. Brown's house was in sight.
The farmer and his wife came to the door to
meet them.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Mr. Brown, "here are
our little friends. Your cheeks are red.
You look as if you had been running.
Didn't your father give you a ride?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Polly. "But we have
been running behind. We have been catching
rides on his sled. He lets us.</p>

<p>"He lets us ride on the runners, too. He
does not wish us to do it except on his sled."</p>

<p>"I hope that you mind him," said Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>"We do," said Polly.</p>

<p>"Shall we go out to the barn?" asked the
farmer. "Where is Wag-wag? Didn't you
bring him? He might have come."</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was invited," said Polly.
"Yes, let's go to the barn. Let's see everything
you have there. Have you any little
lambs?"</p>

<p>"It is not quite time for little lambs yet.
But you can see all the sheep. They look
fatter than they did last summer. That is
because their wool has grown longer. When
we get back, it will be dinner time."</p>

hay," said Farmer Brown. "I think she lays
her eggs there. But I cannot find them."</p>

<p>"Let us go up into the hay to look for
them," said Polly.</p>

<p>So the children hunted. The barn was
not very cold. Still it was not so nice as
in the summer time.</p>

<p>At last Polly nearly tumbled over something.
It was the brown hen. She flew
away with a loud cackle. Then Polly saw
four eggs lying in the hay.</p>

<p>"I've found them, I've found them!" she
shouted. She gave Peter two and took two
herself. Then they went down to show
Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>"You have sharp eyes," he said.</p>

<p>"I used to think I could see better if I
had spectacles," said Polly. "I used to
think that I should have four eyes then."<span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>"I am going to feed the horses now,"
said Mr. Brown. "You may come."</p>

<p>While Mr. Brown did this, Peter and
Polly looked carefully at each horse. They
were hunting for one that they knew.</p>

<img src="images/illus093.jpg" width="398" height="338" alt="" />

<p>It was the old brown mare. They had
ridden horseback on her last summer.
That was when they went with John to
hunt for the turtle's eggs.</p>

<p>"There she is, I think," said Polly.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for John's mare?
Yes, that is the one," said Farmer Brown.<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
"You will not need her to ride any more.
I hear you have a pony of your own."</p>

<p>Then the children told him about their
pony. They told him about the Christmas
tree.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" laughed Farmer Brown.
"Who ever heard of a pony on a Christmas
tree?"</p>

<p>"But think of a pony in a letter box,"
said Polly. And Farmer Brown laughed
still more.</p>

<p>How warm the cow stable was! Polly
said, "How can it be so warm? There is
no stove."</p>

<p>"The cows themselves make it warm,"
said Mr. Brown. "See, here is one just
the color of a deer. Isn't she pretty?"</p>

<p>"I guess the deer would be glad, if they
had such a nice, warm house," said Polly.</p>

<p>"Yes, the winter is hard for them. It is
cold, and food is not easy to find. There
are two that sometimes come to our barnyard.
I give them grain and hay and salt."</p>

<p>"I wish I could see a deer to-day," said
Polly. "Let us go to the barnyard and
look."</p>

<p>"We will feed the sheep now, Polly.<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
You can watch for one while I am doing
that."</p>

<p>When the sheep were fed, it was dinner
time. After dinner Mrs. Brown let the
children play on the piazza.</p>

<p>All at once Peter said, "See the pretty
cow coming down from the woods. Whose
is she? Perhaps she is lost."</p>

<p>"Where, Peter?" asked Polly.</p>

<p>"Coming across the field. Now it is
right there near the fence."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" cried Polly. "That isn't a
cow. I think it is a deer. See its horns."</p>

<p>She called to Mr. Brown. Just as he
came out of the house, the deer reached the
fence. He walked quite close to it. Then
he jumped over it.</p>

<p>"A pretty jump," said Mr. Brown.
"The fence is more than four feet high.
That is a fine stag. A stag is a father
deer, you know."</p>

<p>The stag walked across the road. He
jumped another high fence. Then he
went off up the railroad track.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Polly, "I wish I could jump
like that. He didn't run at all."</p>

<p>"It was a pretty sight," said Mr. Brown.<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
"I am sorry the old fellow did not stop for
dinner. I am afraid he will have nothing
better than bark and twigs, now."</p>

<img src="images/illus096.jpg" width="394" height="366" alt="" />

<p>"It wasn't a cow, was it?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"Cows can't jump like that, Peter.
Though perhaps one did. I have heard of
a cow that jumped over the moon. Have
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. But I know she didn't
really. Oh, here is father. We will tell
him about my pretty cow."</p>

<h2 id="POLLYS_BIRD_PARTY">POLLY'S BIRD PARTY</h2>

<p>"Do you remember something, father?"
asked Polly.</p>

<p>"What is it, chick?"</p>

<p>"Something you told me not to forget,
father."</p>

<p>"Let me think. What was it? Yes, I
remember now. We were to put out some
food for the birds. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"That is it. So, let us do it now."</p>

<p>"Very well," said father. "We will. But
mother must help. She must give us bones."</p>

<p>"Bones!" said Polly. "Birds don't eat
bones. But dogs do. If we put out bones,
Wag-wag will get them."</p>

<p>"Wag-wag will not get these," said father.
"I shall tie them up in the trees. Wag-wag
has not learned to climb trees."</p>

<p>"I saw him trying one day," said Polly.
"He was after a chipmunk. The chipmunk
ran up a tree. Wag-wag put his fore paws<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
on the trunk. He stood up on his hind
feet. He tried hard to get up that trunk.
He barked and barked."</p>

<p>"What did the chipmunk do?" asked
father.</p>

<p>"The chipmunk stopped on a branch
over his head. He sat there and chattered.
Grandmother said he was laughing.</p>

<p>"She told me he was saying, 'You can't
come up, Wag-wag. You can't come up.
You don't know how to climb. I am
safe!'"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was saying that," said father.
"Now here are the bones."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Polly. "They have
meat and fat on them. That is for the
birds. They need not try to eat bones."</p>

<p>"Yes, and here is grass seed. Some
birds would rather have that. And here
is cracked corn, too. It is for the larger
birds."</p>

<p>He put the grass seed into small baskets.
He did the same with the corn.</p>

<p>"Now we are ready," he said. "You
help me carry these things out. I will
come back for the stepladder."</p>

<p>Soon father had tied the bones to the<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
trees. He put them on the small branches.
He tied them so that the birds could get at
them easily. The birds could perch on the
branches and peck at the meat.</p>

<p>He said, "I will not tie them to large
branches. Some cat might walk out and
catch our birds."</p>

<p>Then he fastened up the baskets. He
fastened them tightly. They could not
swing. The birds could perch upon the
edge and eat the seeds and the corn.</p>

<p>"Now our party is ready," said father.
"Do you suppose anything will come to
it? We will keep food here the rest of the
winter."</p>

<p>How Peter and Polly watched the food!
It seemed as if the birds would never come.
But at last they found it.</p>

<p>The very next morning Polly saw two
birds eating there. She did not know what
they were. She ran to tell mother.</p>

<p>"See our birds!" she cried. "We have
two. What are they, oh, what are they?"</p>

<p>"You know them in the summer," said
mother. "Then the father bird is yellow
and black. You call them your canaries."</p>

<p>"But they have changed their clothes,"<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
said Polly. "They do not look the same.
They are not so pretty."</p>

<img src="images/illus100.jpg" width="400" height="328" alt="" />

<p>"Many birds change their color," said
mother. "Do you dress in the winter just
as you do in the summer? How those
birds like the seeds!"</p>

<p>"There, there!" cried Polly. "See that
big bird. He is after the meat. I know
him. He is a blue jay. Don't you frighten
away my other birds, Mr. Blue Jay."</p>

<p>It was not long before many birds found
the food. Day after day the chick-a-dees
feasted. A few crows came. Once a flock<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
of snowbirds stopped at the party. And
there were many that Peter and Polly did
not know.</p>

<p>One day Polly saw a bird that she liked
very much. It was a robin. She was surprised
and pleased.</p>

<p>"I did not know that robins were here
in cold weather," she said to him. "I like
you best of all. You make me think of
spring. Peter likes winter best. But I like
you and spring. Please come to see me
every day."</p>

<img src="images/illus101.jpg" width="400" height="246" alt="" />

<p>And the robin did for nearly a month.
Then he came no more. Perhaps he grew
tired of waiting for spring. Perhaps he
flew south to find it. Polly never knew.</p>

<h2 id="THE_NEW_SLED">THE NEW SLED</h2>

<p>"I am going to begin to make something
to-day," said father. "The stove is lighted.
The workshop is warm. Who will be my
helper?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Polly.</p>

<p>"I will," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Very well. You may both help.
Come to the shop and guess what we are
to make."</p>

<p>The workshop was in Mr. Howe's barn.
In it was a large workbench. Tools hung
on the walls. A box of tools was near the
bench.</p>

<p>On the other side of the shop there was
a very low workbench. It had two drawers.
In the drawers were tools.</p>

<p>There were two small hammers. There
were two small saws. There were two
small screw drivers. There were two pots
of glue. There were nails, tacks, and screws.<span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>The big bench and the big tools were
for Mr. Howe. The little bench and the
little tools were for Peter and Polly.</p>

<p>It was not hard to guess what was to be
made. Father had laid the pieces of wood
together. Any one could tell what they
would make.</p>

<p>"It's a sled like your low one," said
Polly. "I think it must be for Brownie.
It is too small for a big horse."</p>

<p>"That is just what it is, Polly. Grandmother
wished to give you a sleigh. But
this will be better. If you tip over, you
will not fall far.</p>

<p>"I am glad to have you learn to use
Brownie in the winter, too. The snow will
make a soft cushion, if you fall off your
sled."</p>

<p>The parts of the sled had been made for
father. He needed only to put them together.
This did not take very long.</p>

<p>"Now," said father, "the carpenters have
finished their work. We must draw our
sled to the blacksmith's shop."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"For the iron runners, my boy. They
will make your sled slip easily. The blacksmith<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
has been making them. He says
that he will fit them on to-morrow."</p>

<img src="images/illus104.jpg" width="146" height="341" alt="" class="split" />

<p>So the three took the
sled to the blacksmith.
On the way Polly rode a
little. Then Peter rode
a little. Father was the
horse.</p>

<p>Once he played that he
was running away. He
tumbled Polly off into the
soft snow. The children
thought this great fun.</p>

<p>At the blacksmith's shop
they saw the runners.
These did not quite fit the
wooden runners. Polly
felt sorry about this.</p>

<p>But the blacksmith said, "Never you
mind, Polly. I can heat them at the forge.
That will make them soft. Then I can
bend them as I wish.</p>

<p>"You ought to know about this.
Haven't you seen me shoe horses? Haven't
you seen me make the shoes fit?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Polly. "But, you see, I
forgot about that."<span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>The next afternoon the sled came home.
The blacksmith's boy drew it. The iron
runners were on. They fitted well.</p>

<p>"Now," said father, "we have another
job to begin to-morrow. We must paint
the sled. What color shall it be?"</p>

<p>The children talked about it a long time.</p>

<p>At last Polly said, "Peter likes red and I
like red. May we paint it red, father?"</p>

<p>"Red is a good color," said father. "We
will paint it red. See that your brushes are
soft. You must help on the work, you know."</p>

<p>The next day the painting began. Each
child had a part to do all alone. Of course,
Peter got paint on his hands. And there
were large, red spots on his clothes. But
they were old, and no one cared.</p>

<p>The first coat of paint dried quickly in
the warm room. Then another was put on,
and the work was done.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly went to the workshop
many times a day to look at the sled.
They touched the paint with their fingers.
Surely it must be dry.</p>

<p>At last father said, "The paint is hard
now. The sled is ready for use. We will
harness Brownie to it to-morrow."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>

<img src="images/illus106.jpg" width="396" height="156" alt="" />

<h2 id="BROWNIE">BROWNIE</h2>

<p>"Now may we harness Brownie?" asked
Polly.</p>

<p>"Now you may," said father.</p>

<p>He drew out the new, red sled. He put
on Brownie's little harness. He helped the
children harness her to the sled.</p>

<p>They jumped in. Polly had the reins.
She said, "Get up, Brownie," and Brownie
walked out of the yard.</p>

<p>"First, we will show grandmother," said
Polly. "Brownie is grandmother's present.
She must see us driving her."</p>

<p>They stopped in front of grandmother's
house. Peter went in to call her to the door.
Polly held Brownie.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said grandmother, "that is<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
nice. What a pretty sled you have. I like
the color."</p>

<p>"We helped to make it," said Polly.
"We wished you to see us first. We are
going to show the children now. Hear our
pretty sleigh bells. Good-by."</p>

<p>Down the hill Brownie trotted. Her
bells jingled softly. She went across the
railroad track and into the bridge.</p>

<p>Some of the village children were looking
over the railing. They were watching men
cutting ice.</p>

<p>When they saw Peter and Polly, they
cried, "Here comes the pony! See Peter
and Polly! Look at the red sled! Give us
a ride! Oh, give us a ride!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we will," said Polly. "Come up
on the street, where it is smooth. Two of
you get in with us. We will take two more
by and by."</p>

<p>Polly could drive quite well. She had
often driven father's horse, when father took
her with him. She let each child hold
Brownie's reins.</p>

<p>"Let more ride at once," said one of the
girls. "There is room in the sled."</p>

<p>"No," said Polly. "The pony is strong,<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
but she is little. I will not let her drag more
than four. And two are enough, going uphill."</p>

<img src="images/illus108.jpg" width="386" height="502" alt="" />

<p>So they trotted up and down the street.
Sometimes the boys and girls who were not<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
riding ran by Brownie's side. Brownie
seemed to enjoy the fun as much as any of
them.</p>

<p>At last it was time to go home. The children
all patted the pony. This was to thank
her for the good time she had given them.
Then Peter and Polly drove away, up the
hill.</p>

<p>Mother came out of the house. She said,
"Do you think you can do an errand for
me? Can you drive to the creamery? I
wish some buttermilk. Here is a pail for it."</p>

<p>"What fun," said Polly. "Yes, of course,
we can do that. You hold the pail, Peter."</p>

<p>Down the hill they trotted again. At the
creamery, Polly took the pail. She went
inside.</p>

<p>She said, "Have you some buttermilk for
me?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," said the creamery man. "Just
hold your pail under the faucet."</p>

<p>"See our new pony," said Polly. "See
our new sled."</p>

<p>"Are you driving your pony? I saw her
the day she came. She is a fine pony. If
you tip over going home, come back for
more buttermilk."<span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you," said Polly. "We have not
tipped over yet."</p>

<p>"There always has to be a first time,"
said the man.</p>

<p>Going up the hill, Polly said, "We are
nearly home. Perhaps we shall not tip over
to-day. Why does every one think that we
shall?"</p>

<p>But, as they turned into their driveway,
Polly pulled the wrong rein. Brownie
stepped to the side of the road. One of the
sled runners struck a bank of snow.</p>

<p>Over went sled, children, and buttermilk.
Brownie stopped and looked around. Polly
was standing on her head in the soft snow.
Peter was covered with buttermilk. No one
was hurt.</p>

<p>Polly scrambled up. She pulled Peter
to his feet. She said, "Don't cry, Peter.
Buttermilk will not hurt you. You like it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Peter. "But that is
inside, not outside. How would you like it
down your neck?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Polly, "you get into the sled
again. We must go back for more buttermilk.
You may drive all the way. Perhaps
you won't tip us over."</p>

<h2 id="DISH-PAN_SLEDS">DISH-PAN SLEDS</h2>

<p>"Peter and Polly," said mother, "should
you like to play a new game?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, oh, yes! Tell us fast!" cried
both children.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," said mother. "But
I will show you. Get ready to go out of
doors. Here comes Tim. That is good.
He may play, too."</p>

<p>"How many can be in this game,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Ever so many, Polly. Please take
this dish pan. Peter, carry this pan. Tim,
here is one for you. Now follow me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Howe went through the open gate
into the hayfield. A hard crust was on the
top of the snow.<span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>"See, children," she said, "what a fine
crust. It holds me up. It is just right for
sliding. By and by the sun will make it soft."</p>

<p>"I wish we had our sleds," said Peter.
"Let's go back for them."</p>

<p>"You have them with you," said mother.
"That is the game."</p>

<p>"I don't see any game," said Peter. "And
I don't see any sleds."</p>

<p>"Then I will show you, my son. Bring
your big pan here. Put it down on the
edge of the hill. Now sit in it. Hold on
to the handles. Keep your feet up. You
need not steer. You can't run into anything
here. Now go."</p>

<p>Mother gave Peter a push. Away he
went on the icy crust.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother!" cried Polly, jumping
up and down. "Look at Peter, look! I
want to go! I want to go!"</p>

<p>"In a minute," said mother. "Watch
Peter, first."</p>

<p>Peter's dish-pan sled was not like a real
sled. It did not go straight. It turned
around and around. First Peter slid backward,
then sideways. At last he reached
the bottom.<span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus113.jpg" width="390" height="344" alt="" />

<p>He stood up and looked around. Then
he laughed.</p>

<p>"Did you like it, Peter?" called mother.</p>

<p>"I did! I did!" cried Peter. "It felt just
like sliding and rolling down hill at the same
time. I am going to play this game all the
morning. Let's all go now."</p>

<p>"Very well," said mother. "If you bump
into one another, it won't hurt you. Get
ready."</p>

<p>So the children, in their dish-pan sleds,<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
started down the hill. Polly bumped into
Tim. This made him spin around and
around. Polly went the rest of the way
backward. Near the bottom she fell out.</p>

<p>Just then Wag-wag came running up the
field. He was dragging Peter's sled behind
him.</p>

<p>He had heard the children and was coming
to find them. Perhaps he thought they had
forgotten Peter's sled.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, look!" said Polly. "Wag-wag
has a sled, too. Let's give him a slide.
Come here, Wag-wag. Come here, sir."</p>

<p>But Wag-wag would not come. Instead,
he ran up the hill past Mrs. Howe. The
children picked up their dish pans and
chased him.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said mother. "When
he is tired of playing with the sled, he may
bring it back. Or you can go after it.</p>

<p>"Now good-by. Slide until the crust is
soft. Then come in. Do you like the new
game, children?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we do, we do!" they all cried.</p>

<p>"And we like our new sleds, mother. We
are going to name them," said Polly.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell my mother not to<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
wash dishes any more. I am going to tell
her to give me her dish pan," said Tim.</p>

<p>The children slid for a long time. At last
the crust began to be soft. They sank in a
little at every step.</p>

<p>"I shall slide once more," Polly said.
"Then I shall go home."</p>

<p>"I shall get my sled first," said Peter.
"I wish Wag-wag had not left it so far
away."</p>

<p>Peter started across the field. Before
long, he came to a place where the snow
was very soft. He sank into it as far as his
legs could go. He could not get to the sled.
So he went home feeling quite cross.</p>

<p>Tim's father was in the yard. He had
come for Tim. Collie was with him.</p>

<p>Peter said, "Wag-wag is a bad dog. He
left my sled out in the field. The snow is
soft. I cannot get to it."</p>

<p>Tim said, "My father will send Collie
after your sled, Peter. Won't you, father?"</p>

<p>"Oh, will you?" asked Peter. "I shall
want to slide in the road after dinner. Dish
pans are not good in the road. So I need
my sled."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Tim's father. "Collie<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
can get it. He will not break through the
crust as you do."</p>

<p>He showed Tim's sled to Collie. He put
the rope into Collie's mouth. He pointed
to the end of the big field. Then he said,
"Collie, go bring the sled."</p>

<p>Collie was a wise dog. He understood
many things that were said to him. He
knew what his master wished him to do
now.</p>

<p>He went running over the snow. He
found the sled and drew it home.</p>

<p>"Good old Collie," said his master, patting
him.</p>

<p>"There," said Tim, "I told you Collie
is smarter than Wag-wag. He is, too."</p>

<p>"Maybe he isn't," said Peter. "Maybe
Wag-wag was smart to leave my sled there.
But anyway I like Collie because he got it
for me."</p>

<p>One winter day grandmother had been
visiting Mrs. Brown. In the afternoon she
started for home. The sun was warm.
The snow was packed hard in the road.
The walking was good.</p>

<p>Grandmother liked the cold, crisp air.
She liked the blue sky, and the hills and fields
all white with snow. She liked to hear the
chick-a-dees, calling among the trees.</p>

<p>She was halfway home, when she heard
a noise behind her. It was, "Meow, meow."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a cat," said grandmother
to herself. "But, of course, it is
not. No cat would be in these woods in
winter."</p>

<p>"Meow, meow," came the sound again.</p>

<p>This time grandmother looked around.
What do you think she saw? There, in the
road behind her, were two black and white
kittens. They were trotting along side by
side. They looked just alike.<span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>Grandmother stopped and called, "Kitty,
kitty, kitty! Come here, you pretty kitties.
Where did you come from? Are you following
me?"</p>

<p>As soon as grandmother stopped, the kittens,
too, stopped. She went back toward
them. When she did this, the kittens turned
and ran away. They did not wish to be
caught.</p>

<p>Grandmother called to them again. She
tried in every way to get near them. But
she could not.</p>

<p>At last she said, "Poor kittens! You do
not know that I am your friend. I do not
like to leave you here in the cold. But I
cannot stay any longer. I must go home."</p>

<p>So she walked on up the road. When
the kittens saw this, they started after her.
She looked back and saw them following.
Side by side they came, their little pointed
tails straight up.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" said grandmother to
herself. "Now, do you suppose they will
follow me home?"</p>

<p>She kept looking back to see. Every time
she looked, the kittens were coming. But,
if she stopped, they stopped.<span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>Through the village they went. They
did not seem afraid. There were no people
about. Not a dog was to be seen.</p>

<p>At last they reached grandmother's house.</p>

<p>"Now," said grandmother, "you have followed
me to my door. Are you looking for
a new home? Did you pick me out to be
your mistress? If you really wish to live
with me, you may. We shall see."</p>

<p>She unlocked the door and went in. She
left the door open. And after her went the
two black and white kittens. They ran
under the stove at once. Then grandmother
shut the door.</p>

<p>In a short time she gave them some warm
milk. When they had finished it, they took
a walk around the room.</p>

<p>One found grandmother's workbasket.
Then he felt sure that he should like his new
home. He began to play with the spools.</p>

<p>His brother saw him. He thought he
should like a game, too. So he rolled some
of the spools out on the floor. But grandmother
put the basket away before they did
much harm.</p>

<p>Just then the telephone bell rang. The
kittens both looked around. One jumped<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
upon the table. From there he jumped to
the telephone box.</p>

<img src="images/illus120.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="" />

<p>He put his paw on the bell, which kept
ringing. Perhaps he thought it would play
with him. Perhaps he did not like the noise.</p>

<p>Then one jumped up into grandmother's
lap. She patted it; and soon the other
came, too.</p>

<p>"You funny kittens," said grandmother.
"You are almost alike. You, sir, have a
black spot on this leg. You have not. If
you are to be my kittens, I must name you.</p>

<p>"You are so nearly alike, I shall call you
Cat and Copy-cat. And, if you are good,
you shall always live with me.</p>

<p>"Now I will telephone to Peter and Polly
about you."</p>

<h2 id="POLLYS_SNOWSHOES">POLLY'S SNOWSHOES</h2>

<p>"Peter, I've thought of something. Let's
make some snowshoes."</p>

<p>"How do you do it, Polly?"</p>

<p>"I think I know. I saw a pair this
morning. They were made of barrel
staves. They are not real snowshoes, of
course."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Peter. "Father's
snowshoes are not made of barrel staves.
Let's go to look at his. Let's make some
like them."</p>

<p>"We can't, Peter. But we can make the
other kind. Let's see if there is a broken
barrel. Then we'll ask mother if we may
have four staves."</p>

<p>"My flour barrel is just empty," said
mother. "We will roll it outside. I will
knock it to pieces. Then you may have
your four staves. Please clean them out
of doors. If you do not, you will get flour
all over the workshop."<span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>When the children took the staves into
the workshop, Peter said, "What next?"</p>

<p>"We want four strips of leather next.
They are for straps. We will tack one
strap on each stave. They will go across
the staves. We will tack them at the
sides. They must be loose. We shall put
our toes under them."</p>

<p>"How will our snowshoes stay on?"
asked Peter.</p>

<p>"I'll show you by and by. I must ask
mother to cut this leather for me."</p>

<p>When the leather was cut, Polly tacked
on the straps. The snowshoes now looked
like this:</p>

<img src="images/illus122.jpg" width="400" height="71" alt="" />

<p>"I wish to put mine on," said Peter.</p>

<p>So he stuck his toes under the leather
straps. He scuffed over the floor. Then
he tried to go backward. But he only
pulled his feet out of the leather straps.</p>

<p>"They will not stay on. I knew they
would not," he said. "I do not like them
very well."<span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>"I'm fixing mine so that they will stay
on," said Polly. "I will fix yours, too."</p>

<p>To each end of the leather straps Polly
had tied a piece of soft rope. Her snowshoes
now looked like this:</p>

<img src="images/illus123.jpg" width="396" height="76" alt="" />

<p>"Put your toes under the straps, Peter.
I will wind the ropes back of your heels.
Now they go around your ankles and tie in
front. See if the snowshoes will come off
now."</p>

<p>Peter scuffed around the room again.
The snowshoes held fast. They worked
very well when he scuffed. But, if he tried
to step, the backs flew up and hit him.</p>

<p>"Father's don't do that," said Peter.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Polly. "There are
holes in father's. His toes go down
through those holes. You haven't any
holes. So your toes push the front of
your snowshoes down. Then the backs
fly up and hit you. You must scuff, not
walk."</p>

<p>"I will," said Peter. "Let's go out of<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
doors and try them. They are good snowshoes
now."</p>

<img src="images/illus124.jpg" width="394" height="308" alt="" />

<p>So out the children went. There was
a little crust. The children walked on it.
Their snowshoes held them up.</p>

<p>They called to mother. She must see
them. Mother looked through the window.
She clapped her hands.</p>

<p>All went well for a few steps. Then
the toe of Polly's snowshoe caught. It cut
into the crust.</p>

<p>This pulled Polly forward. She fell on
her face. Her arms stuck down into the<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
snow. The points of her snowshoes stuck
down into the snow, too. At first Polly
could not get up.</p>

<p>Then she rolled over on her side. She
was almost on her feet again, when Wag-wag
dashed up.</p>

<p>He had seen Polly rolling in the snow.
He thought it was a game. He wished to
play, too.</p>

<p>He took the end of one snowshoe in his
teeth. He pulled and pulled. He shook
the snowshoe. Then he jumped around
Polly and on her.</p>

<p>Polly was laughing so that she could not
scold him. She could only say, "Oh, don't,
Wag-wag! Don't!"</p>

<p>Mother and Peter were laughing. And
perhaps Wag-wag was laughing, too.</p>

<p>At last he stopped playing. Mother
came out of the house. She threw a broom
to Polly. Polly helped herself up with
this.</p>

<p>She said, "These are good snowshoes.
They are best when I am on them. They
are not so good when I am down. But I
think that I can do better than that next
time."</p>

<h2 id="THE_WOODS_IN_WINTER">THE WOODS IN WINTER</h2>

<p>"We are going on a picnic to-day, chicks,"
said Mr. Howe.</p>

<p>"A picnic, father! I thought picnics were
in summer."</p>

<p>"So they are, Polly. But why not have
a winter picnic, too? I am going into the
woods. You may come, if you wish."</p>

<p>"But at picnics we have things to eat.
We eat out of doors."</p>

<p>"We shall have things to eat to-day.
And we shall eat out of doors, too."</p>

<p>"But, father, we shall be cold!"</p>

<p>"What keeps us warm in the house in
winter, Polly?"</p>

<p>"A fire," said Polly. "Oh, now I know,
now I know! You will build a fire in the
woods. Once you promised me that you
would. Goody, goody, goody, goody!"
And Polly jumped up and down for joy.</p>

<p>"What shall we eat?" asked Peter.
"Just bread and butter?"<span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, no," said father. "We shall have
bread and butter, of course. But we shall
have other things, too. We will cook our
dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" cried both children.</p>

<p>"Are you glad? I thought you would
like it. Now help me get ready. Please
get my knapsack, Polly."</p>

<p>In the kitchen, mother was busy spreading
bread. She wrapped paper around the
slices. She put coffee into a small, cheese-cloth
bag. She filled a flat bottle with
milk.</p>

<p>Father took six eggs. He rolled them up
in paper. He put a jar of bacon into his
knapsack. Then the bread, coffee, and eggs
were fitted in. The bottle of milk went into
his pocket.</p>

<p>"We will take my camp dishes," he said.
"I will fasten my hatchet to my belt. Get
on your things, and we are ready."</p>

<p>"Let's play that we are Indians," said
Polly. "Where are we going, father?"</p>

<p>"Up the wood road on the hill. I must
see if all our wood has been cut. We need
a little for our furnace, a little for our stove,
and a great deal for our fireplaces.<span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>"Let's all keep our eyes wide open to-day.
We may see interesting things."</p>

<p>"I think that cooking our dinner will be
interesting, father. I almost wish it were
dinner time now."</p>

<p>"We will build our fire where our trees
have been cut.
There we shall find
plenty of firewood,"
said father.</p>

<img src="images/illus128.jpg" width="150" height="301" alt="" class="splitr" />

<p>"See those tracks
in the snow, children.
A rabbit has been
here. Yes, this hollow
is where he lies.
The snow is packed
hard. It is a little
dirty, too. Perhaps
he is near by, watching
us."</p>

<p>"Poor rabbit," said
Polly. "What a
cold bed. The Eskimos
have snow
beds. But they have fur rugs to cover the
snow."</p>

<p>"The rabbit has one between him and the<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
snow, too. Only his rug is on his back. It
keeps him warm," said father.</p>

<p>"Look, look!" cried Polly. "Over there
by those trees!"</p>

<p>"That's surely a rabbit, Polly. See him
jump along. He is nearly as white as the
snow. He did not wait for us to call, did he?"</p>

<p>"What big jumps," said Polly. "I think
he could beat Wag-wag."</p>

<p>"I am sure that he could, Polly. His
hind legs are very long. They are made
for jumping. He can take twice as big
jumps as he is taking now. But he will
not, unless we frighten him."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he go into a hole in the
winter? Why doesn't he sleep until spring
comes? The woodchuck does. Why doesn't
he?" asked Polly.</p>

<p>"He is not made so that he can. Some
animals store up fat on themselves. In the
winter they go to sleep.</p>

<p>"Then they seem to live on that fat.
For, in the spring, they are always thin
and hungry looking.</p>

<p>"You couldn't do that, you know. And
the rabbit cannot do it. What are those
birds, Peter?"<span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>"Chickadees," said Peter. "I always
know them. They cannot fool me. They
never say anything but 'chick-a-dee.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they do, my son. Listen!
What is that? There it is again."</p>

<p>"Some one is whistling," said Polly.
"Isn't it a pretty whistle?"</p>

<p>"It is just two notes," said father.
"Aren't they sweet and clear?"</p>

<p>"It is quite near. But I cannot see any
one. Are you doing it, father?" asked
Polly. "Why, now I can hear three
people."</p>

<p>"Look above you, Polly. You will see
who is whistling."</p>

<p>Polly looked. There on a limb of a tree
was a chick-a-dee. He was singing those
two notes. In the next tree another was
singing two other notes.</p>

<img src="images/illus130.jpg" width="150" height="97" alt="" class="split" />

<p>"So you see, Peter, that they do say
something besides 'chick-a-dee.'
These two notes are
their song. The other is just
their talk. Perhaps you can
learn to whistle those notes.</p>

<p>"Here is the place where our wood has
been cut. Let us look at it."</p>

<h2 id="THE_WINTER_PICNIC">THE WINTER PICNIC</h2>

<p>"Yes," said father, "we shall have plenty
of wood. See, this wood with rough bark
is maple. This, with smooth bark and
lighter spots, is beech. We will not use it
in our fireplaces. It might snap sparks out
on the floor.</p>

<p>"And here is some beautiful white birch.
This is for our fireplaces. Here is yellow
birch, too. Yes, there is plenty for next
winter."</p>

<p>"If we were really Indians, we could
make canoes out of the white birch bark,"
said Polly.</p>

<p>"Isn't it nice here? The trees are thick
all about us. How still it is!"</p>

<p>"It is still in the woods in winter," said
father. "I always like it."</p>

<p>"I think it is too bad to cut the trees
down, father. Will they grow again?"</p>

<p>"See, Polly," said father. "We have<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
cut down only the largest trees. They
were as large as they would ever be. Now
the smaller ones will have a better chance
to grow.</p>

<p>"I would not cut them all down, unless
I planted more. It would not be good for
my land to do that.</p>

<p>"This is the spot for our fire. Let us
make it now."</p>

<p>He found a place, near a log, where the
snow was not deep. He cleared most of it
away. There he built the fire. He used
pieces of birch bark instead of paper.
Small twigs made very good kindling wood.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly pulled birch bark from
the logs. They broke up the dry twigs.</p>

<p>With his hatchet, father cut sticks of
wood. He laid some of these on the fire.
He stuck his kettle irons down into the
snow. They looked like this:</p>

<img src="images/illus132.jpg" width="150" height="106" alt="" class="splitr" />

<p>Then he lighted the fire.</p>

<p>He filled the coffeepot
with snow. He hung it on
the hook of the kettle irons.
It was quite near the blaze. When the
snow had melted, more was put in.</p>

<p>Father said, "It takes much snow to<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
make a coffeepot full of water. When the
water boils, we will put in the bag of
coffee."</p>

<img src="images/illus133.jpg" width="398" height="488" alt="" />

<p>Polly had taken out the camp dishes. She
said, "We must have three plates, three cups,
three knives and forks and spoons. I will<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
put them on this log. I will put the bread
and butter on the log, too."</p>

<p>Father had cut a straight stick. It looked
like a cane. He took out the frying pan.</p>

<p>"This stick is my handle," said he.
"See where it fits in. Now I shall not
need to stand too near the fire. Frying
would be hot work, if I had not a long
handle. Give me the bacon, Peter."</p>

<p>Soon the bacon was cooking nicely.
How good it smelled! Then the eggs were
dropped into the pan.</p>

<p>When they were fried, father said, "Dinner
is ready. Bring your cups. You are
to have a little coffee. It will be mostly
milk."</p>

<p>This was a great treat. Peter and Polly
did not drink coffee at home. Then father
gave them their bacon and eggs.</p>

<p>"Why," said father, "I forgot the sugar
for our coffee."</p>

<p>"Mother did not," said Polly. "I saw her
put it in, and here it is."</p>

<p>How good everything tasted! They sat
on the log near the fire to eat. So they
were quite warm.</p>

<p>"This is the best dinner I ever had,"<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
said Polly. "Who taught you to cook,
father? I forgot all about playing Indians,
I have been so busy."</p>

<p>When dinner was over, father picked up
the dishes. He wiped them with paper
napkins. He put them into their case.
Mother would wash them at home.</p>

<p>The fire burned low. He threw some
snow on it. This made it safe to leave.</p>

<p>"Now I will show you some tracks," said
he. "They were made by the white-footed
mouse. See how small they are. That line
in the snow is where he dragged his tail.</p>

<p>"He must have gone up into this tree.
But I cannot see him anywhere. Perhaps
he lives in that old nest up there. He may
have watched us eat our dinner."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. White-foot," called Polly.
"We are sorry not to see you. We are
going home now."</p>

<p>Down the hill through the quiet woods
they went. Polly had the big knapsack
over her shoulder. It was quite empty now,
and not at all heavy. Peter ran ahead.</p>

<p>At the door, Polly said, "Thank you,
father, for our good time. It is the best
picnic that I ever had."</p>

<h2 id="THE_SEWING_LESSON">THE SEWING LESSON</h2>

<p>"Mother," said Polly one day, "I wish I
could sew something real. I am tired of
my patchwork. I wish I could make a dress
for my doll. She needs a new dress."</p>

<p>"Then you shall try it, Polly. Go to
the drawer in the sewing table. You will
find a pattern at the back of the drawer.
It is for you."</p>

<p>"O mother!" said Polly. "How did
you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I knew you would need it soon.
Here is the cloth for the dress."</p>

<p>She gave Polly some pretty blue cloth.
She said, "Spread it out on the table. Pin
the pattern smoothly to the cloth. Be sure to
pin it straight. Now cut around the edge."</p>

<p>Polly worked very carefully. At last
she said, "See, mother, this is what I have
left. There was too much."<span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>Just then Peter came into the room.
"What are you doing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am cutting out a doll's dress. See
my pattern. See my pretty cloth."</p>

<p>"What is this piece for?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Polly. "That is left
over. I do not need it at all."</p>

<p>"I wish I could have it," said Peter. "I
wish I could sew something, too."</p>

<p>"You may have it," said mother. "You
may sew something. What do you wish
to sew?"</p>

<p>"Let me see, mother. I think I will
make me some clothes."</p>

<p>"There is not quite cloth enough for
that, Peter. Besides, it would be hard to
do. Why not make a bean bag?"</p>

<p>"That would be good," said Peter.
"Where are the beans?"</p>

<p>"You shall have them when the bag is
finished," said mother.</p>

<p>"But I must have them now. I must
sew around them, mustn't I?"</p>

<p>"No, dear. This is the way we do it.
First we cut it right. Then we turn the
edges. Then we baste them together.</p>

<p>"Here is a little thimble. Here is a large<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
needle. Begin at this corner. Make your
stitches as small as you can.</p>

<p>"If they are too far apart, your beans will
fall out, by and by. How are you getting
on, Polly?"</p>

<p>"I have some of the pieces basted together.
May I stop basting and sew a little?"</p>

<p>"If you like. Aren't you glad now that
you can sew over and over so nicely?"</p>

<p>Peter and Polly did not finish their work
that day. But at last the bean bag was done.
Then Peter took it to Tim's house. He
wished to show Tim what he had made.</p>

<p>At last the dress, too, was finished.
How pleased Polly was! She put it on
her doll at once.</p>

<p>She said, "Now I will take her calling.
I will show her to the other children.
They will all wish to make dresses."</p>

<p>"If they do, we will cut the patterns for
them," said mother. "Perhaps we can
have a little sewing school. I will be the
teacher, and you may be my helper.
Should you like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should, I should, mother. You
do think of nice things. I will go this
minute and tell the other girls."</p>

<h2 id="FISHING_THROUGH_THE_ICE">FISHING THROUGH THE ICE</h2>

<p>"I wish I could go fishing," said Peter.</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait until summer," said
Polly.</p>

<p>"Then I wish it were summer now."</p>

<p>"Why, Peter Howe! When it was summer,
you wished for winter. Now it is winter,
you would like it to be summer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter. "You see, when I
wished for winter, I forgot all about fishing.
Anyway it will be summer soon."</p>

<p>"Not very soon," said Polly. "Will it,
mother?"</p>

<p>"I will take you fishing," said father.</p>

<p>"How can you?" cried Peter. "Can
you make it summer?"</p>

<p>"No, but I can take you fishing just the<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
same. Get ready and we will go. Polly
may come, too, if she likes."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" shouted Peter. "Where
is my fish pole, mother?"</p>

<p>"You will not need it, Peter," said father.
"We shall need just our lines, hooks,
sinkers, and bait.</p>

<p>"Put an extra pair of mittens in your
pocket. You might take the red ones that
the snow man liked so well."</p>

<p>They walked up the road. By and by
they came to a bridge. At one end they
climbed down to the river.</p>

<p>Here they found a path. It took them
on to the river. At the end of the path
the snow was trodden down. Peter saw
two holes in the ice.</p>

<p>"Father," he said, "see those holes. Who
made them?"</p>

<p>"The blacksmith and his boy chopped
them yesterday. Then they fished through
them. You see now why the blacksmith
did not shoe Brownie yesterday.</p>

<p>"He knew you would be sorry about that.
So he told me to bring you fishing."</p>

<p>"I'd rather do this than anything else,"
said Peter. "I will thank him for his holes."<span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>"You will not like to do it long," said
father. "It is a cold day."</p>

<p>He baited Polly's hook and Peter's hook.
He showed them how far into the water to
put their lines.</p>

<p>Then he said, "While you are fishing, I
will build a little fire. There are plenty of
small pieces of wood by the bank. You
may warm your fingers at my fire. Perhaps
the fish will not bite to-day."</p>

<p>"Did the blacksmith catch any?" asked
Polly. "Oh, yes," said father.</p>

<p>"Maybe he caught them all," said Polly.
"I haven't had a bite yet. I am getting
cold standing here."</p>

<p>"Then come and warm your fingers at
my fire," said father.</p>

<p>Just then Peter said, "I feel something!"
And he began to pull up his line.</p>

<p>As soon as he pulled, Polly cried, "Oh,
I feel something, too. It's a bite, a bite!"
And she began to pull up her line.</p>

<p>All at once they both stopped pulling.</p>

<p>"I'm caught," said Polly.</p>

<p>"I'm caught," said Peter. "It won't come
any farther. But it jerks. Maybe it isn't
caught. Maybe it's a big fish."<span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus142.jpg" width="396" height="408" alt="" />

<p>Father began to laugh. "I think your
big fish is Polly," he said. "Let me see."</p>

<p>He took Peter's line. He told Polly to
let hers out slowly. Then he pulled. Surely
enough, Peter's hook came up through his
hole. Polly's hook came up, too.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly had caught each other!
How they laughed at this!</p>

<p>Peter said, "I shall carry my big fish<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
home to mother. She will like it. But she
will not cook it. Let us go now to tell
her."</p>

<p>"Very well," said father. "Roll up your
line. Then warm your hands before we
start."</p>

<p>Polly had dropped her hook back into the
water. All in a minute she felt a good bite.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have one, I have one!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Pull in!" said father.</p>

<p>Polly pulled. Up through the hole came
a beautiful big trout.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" said father. "Isn't
that a beauty? I wonder how it happened
to bite our pork. We must throw it back.
It's too bad."</p>

<p>"O father, my fish!" cried Polly. "Why
did you? Wasn't it a good fish?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it was, Polly. But back it had
to go. We can't keep trout in the winter."</p>

<p>"Then let's go home now," said Polly.
"I might catch more. And I should not
like to throw them back."</p>

<p>"I'm all ready," said Peter. "I think we
have had a good time. You caught a big
fish and I caught a big fish and we can't eat
either of them."</p>

<h2 id="MAKING_MOLASSES_CANDY">MAKING MOLASSES CANDY</h2>

<p>It was a wet, rainy day. Peter and Polly
had been out in the rain. It did not hurt
them.</p>

<p>They had on rubber boots, rubber coats,
and rubber caps. Peter's rubber coat was
yellow. Polly's was black. They played
that they were firemen.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, mother wished them to
stay in the house.</p>

<p>She said, "The rain makes the snow wet.
It is not nice to play in. We will have a
candy party. We will make molasses candy.
You may each pull some."</p>

<p>"I should rather do that than play out of
doors," said Polly.</p>

<p>"So should I," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Very well, children. Put on your
aprons. Now, Polly, get the molasses jug."</p>

<p>Mother measured out the molasses. Then
she put it on the stove to boil. Soon she<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
measured out some white sugar. She poured
it into the molasses.</p>

<p>"Peter, you may carry away the sugar.
That is the way you helped grandmother,
you know."</p>

<p>"Now let me stir," said Polly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said mother. "We do not stir
this candy. I thought you knew better than
that."</p>

<p>Soon the molasses boiled. The children
liked to watch it. They liked the good
smell.</p>

<p>Peter said, "See it bubble up just like our
spring."</p>

<p>"It is the steam, trying to get out, that
makes the bubbles," said mother. "You
know that steam is strong. You have seen
it lift the lid of the teakettle.</p>

<p>"Now let us try the candy. Bring a cup,
Polly. Bring a cup, Peter. Fill them half
full of cold water."</p>

<p>Mother dipped a spoon into the boiling
candy. She poured part of the spoonful
into Polly's cup, and the rest into Peter's cup.</p>

<p>"Let it stand a minute. Then we will
see if the candy is hard enough to pull. After
that you may eat it."<span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<img src="images/illus146.jpg" width="392" height="246" alt="" />

<p>This was just what the children wished to
do. They were glad because mother had to
try the candy again.</p>

<p>At last, it was poured into cake tins. It
was set out of doors to cool. There was
a big tin for mother, a little tin for Polly, and
a little tin for Peter.</p>

<p>Peter and Polly could hardly wait for the
candy to cool. They were in such a hurry
to begin pulling it. Polly stuck her finger
into hers before it was ready. It almost
burned her.</p>

<p>A few minutes after this, mother said,
"Yours is cool enough now. Mine is not.
Wash your hands again. Then you may
begin."<span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>What a sticky time there was!</p>

<p>Polly pulled her piece over and over quite
well. Soon it began to grow light colored.
When it stuck to her hands, she ran out of
doors. This cooled the candy.</p>

<p>But Peter could not pull so fast. His
piece stuck to both hands. It got between
his fingers. Mother scraped it off and he
began again.</p>

<p>At last, he dropped part of it on the floor.
Mother said, "Let it alone, Peter. I will
scrape it up. It is not good to put with yours
now."</p>

<p>Peter said, "I guess I do not like to pull
candy. I am going to make fly paper of
mine. It is sticky enough."</p>

<p>"Yes," said mother. "It is sticky. But
you are doing very well."</p>

<p>"Mine is ready to cut up, I think," said
Polly.</p>

<p>She laid it on the clean kitchen table.
She pulled it out into a long, thin strip.
Then she took a pair of clean scissors. She
cut the strip into short pieces.</p>

<p>"That is just the way," said mother.
"Put it on the buttered plate. You are a
good candy maker. Grandmother must<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>have some of this. O Peter! What are you
doing?"</p>

<img src="images/illus148.jpg" width="390" height="592" alt="" />

<p>Poor Peter had somehow got his hand
stuck to his hair.</p>

<p>"I am just trying to get my hand away,"
said Peter. "But it is stuck."</p>

<p>"I should think it is," said mother. "You
must sit quite still until I get my candy ready
to cut. Then I will help you."</p>

<p>"O Peter! How funny you look!"
laughed Polly. And indeed he did look
funny, with his hand held close to his hair.</p>

<p>"But I don't feel funny, Polly. You stop
laughing at me."</p>

<p>Mother gently pulled his hair away from
the candy. Then she scraped his hands.</p>

<p>"Please save my candy, mother," said
Peter.</p>

<p>"I cannot, Peter. It is not clean now."</p>

<p>And Polly said, "You may have mine,
Peter. I am sorry I laughed."</p>

<p>Then mother washed Peter's hands. "I
must wash your hair, too," she said. "But
never mind. It needed washing. You have
had fun with your candy, haven't you?"</p>

<p>Peter answered, "Yes, I have, mother.
But please do not make it so sticky next time."</p>

<h2 id="GRANDMOTHERS_BIRTHDAY_PARTY">GRANDMOTHER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY</h2>

<p>"Here is grandmother. Light the fire,
Peter. Light the fire, Polly."</p>

<p>Peter and Polly each took a match. Peter
lighted the open fire at the left. Polly
lighted it at the right side.</p>

<p>Soon the kindling wood began to crackle.
Then the flames leaped high in the fireplace.</p>

<p>Grandmother had come over to supper.
She was to spend the evening. It was her
birthday. Peter and Polly were to stay up
later because of this.</p>

<p>The Story Lady was coming to supper,
too. Perhaps, just perhaps, she would tell
them a story. She knew stories about everything.<span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>"Here she is now," cried Polly. And the
Story Lady walked in at the door with
grandmother.</p>

<p>Soon supper was ready. Polly had helped
mother set the table. She thought that it
looked very pretty.</p>

<p>Grandmother's birthday cake was in the
center. On it were a dozen small, colored
candles. Polly had helped to put them
there.</p>

<p>When mother had shown her the candles,
she had said, "Why, mother, grandmother
is more than twelve years old.</p>

<p>"She must have a candle for every year.
That is what I have."</p>

<p>"I know you do, Polly," mother had said.
"But grandmother is sixty years old. We
cannot put sixty candles on this cake. It is
not large enough.</p>

<p>"So we will count the fives in sixty. Then
we will use one for every five years. That
makes just twelve."</p>

<p>"Yes," Polly had answered, "I have
learned that. Twelve fives make sixty. It
is a good way to do. I shall do it when
I am sixty years old."</p>

<p>Now the cake was on the table. Just<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
before it was time to cut it, father lighted
the candles.</p>

<p>They all watched them burn for a few
minutes. The melted wax ran down the
sides. They grew shorter and shorter.</p>

<p>"See Nan Etticoat," said Polly. "The
longer she stands, the shorter she grows.
Do you know that story, grandmother?"</p>

<img src="images/illus152.jpg" width="386" height="384" alt="" />

<p>"My grandmother taught me to say Nan
Etticoat," said grandmother. "That was<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
many years ago. She told me about making
candles, too.</p>

<p>"When she was a little girl, there were no
electric lights. There were no gas lights.
There were no lamps. Every one used
candles.</p>

<p>"Not such pretty, colored ones as these.
They were larger and quite rough. How
should you like to make them, Polly?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should like to," said Polly. "May
we?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said grandmother. "We
do not need to do so. We have other
lights.</p>

<p>"But in those old days, people made
their own candles. They called it 'dipping
candles.' It was a hard task.</p>

<p>"I am sure that they did not light many
at once. I am sure that my grandmother
did not have candles on her birthday
cakes.</p>

<p>"Now, my son, the wax is dripping on
the frosting. The candles are nearly burned.
If you will put them out, I will cut my
birthday cake."</p>

<p>Mr. Howe pinched the lighted ends in his
fingers. He did this very quickly.<span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>"Don't they burn your fingers, father?"
asked Polly.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Polly. I do not give them
time to burn me. This is better than to
blow them out. Then there is smoke. But
children must not do it this way."</p>

<p>Grandmother took the knife and cut the
cake. She cut it as a pie is cut. Each one
had a very fat piece.</p>

<p>"Now we shall see if this cake is as good as
it looks," said grandmother. "I am sure that
it is, for your mother is a good cook, Polly."</p>

<p>But Polly was not listening. She was
looking at something that she had found
in her cake.</p>

<p>She poked it with her fork. Then she
took it up in her fingers.</p>

<p>"Why, mother," she said, "what a queer
thing there is in my cake. How did it get
there?"</p>

<p>Just then Peter said, "There is a lump
in my piece, too. It is something hard."</p>

<p>Father said, "Clean the cake from your
lumps and see what they are. Why, I have
a lump myself."</p>

<p>"And so have I," said the Story Lady.</p>

<p>"And so have I," said mother.<span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>"Then," said grandmother, "I am the
only one who has no lump. How did you
let these lumps fall into your cake, daughter?
Can I ever again call you a good
cook?" And she laughed at Mrs. Howe.</p>

<p>Just then her fork struck something.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" cried grandmother. "A
<img src="images/illus155.jpg" width="150" height="259" alt="" class="splitr" />
lump in my piece,
too! Now I think
they must have
been put in the
cake on purpose."</p>

<p>"Oh, see, see,
grandmother!
See what mine
is!" And Polly
held up a little,
white china pig.</p>

<p>"Look at
mine!" shouted
Peter. He had
scraped the cake
from his lump.
In his hand was
a small, white china monkey.</p>

<p>"What is yours, Story Lady? And yours,
mother? And yours, father?" asked Polly.<span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>"Mine is a cat," said the Story Lady.</p>

<p>"And here is a kitten to go with her,"
said mother.</p>

<p>"And here is a naughty dog, to chase
your cat and kitten," said father. "Let's
put them in a row on the table. Then we
can all see them."</p>

<p>"But where is your lump, grandmother?"
asked Polly.</p>

<p>Grandmother held out her hand. On it,
there lay a beautiful, gold thimble.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Isn't it pretty!" cried Polly.
"Who gave it to you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is, Polly. I think I know who
gave it to me. It was you, my daughter.
You knew that I had lost mine.</p>

<p>"I thank you for this. And I thank you
for another happy birthday party. Perhaps
you may put lumps in your cakes, just on
birthdays."</p>

<p>"I will not do it at other times," said
mother. "Now let us all go into the other
room and sit before the open fire."</p>

<p>"When our bedtime comes we need not
go, need we, mother?" asked Polly.</p>

<p>"Not to-night, Polly. You and Peter
may sit up a while," said mother.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>

<img src="images/illus157.jpg" width="398" height="249" alt="" />

<h2 id="AROUND_THE_OPEN_FIRE">AROUND THE OPEN FIRE</h2>

<p>The open fire was blazing well. "Let
me draw the chairs about it," said father.
"Then we can all enjoy it."</p>

<p>"We do not need chairs, father," said
Polly. "Peter and I will sit on the floor.
I will sit next to grandmother."</p>

<p>"I will sit next to mother," said Peter.</p>

<p>"When I was little," said grandmother,
"I liked to sit on the floor. I thought it
quite soft enough. Now that I am older, I
like chairs better."</p>

<p>"If you sit in a chair, it is never in the
right place," said Polly. "A floor is always
in the right place. It is a big seat, too."</p>

<p>"What a good fireplace this is," said the<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
Story Lady. "It is so large that you can
put real logs into it. And it never smokes."</p>

<p>"Just think of long ago, when there
were no stoves," said grandmother. "How
would it seem now to heat our houses with
open fires?"</p>

<p>"Why weren't there any stoves, grandmother?
And where were the furnaces?"</p>

<p>"People did not know how to make
stoves and furnaces, Peter. They had very
large fireplaces, instead. My grandmother
told me about them."</p>

<p>"What beautiful white birch logs," said the
Story Lady. "They make such a good fire."</p>

<p>"They came from our woods," said Peter.
"We were up there one day. We went
to see next winter's wood. There is plenty.
Some is already cut and piled."</p>

<p>"At first, I did not like to see the pretty
trees cut down," said Polly. "But father
told me that it is sometimes best."</p>

<p>"So it is, Polly," said the Story Lady.
"We need the wood to keep us warm, and
for many other things, too. What are
some of them?"</p>

<p>"Carts, sleds, telephone poles!" shouted
Peter.<span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>"Houses, barns, bridges!" shouted Polly.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, children, for all those and
more. So we must cut down some of the
trees. But we must take care that others
grow in their places.</p>

<p>"Thousands of years ago, people believed
strange things about trees. They believed
that in some lived beings called dryads.</p>

<p>"These dryads were like lovely maidens.
A maiden is a girl, you know. They could
come out of their trees. But still they
were a part of the tree.</p>

<p>"If a tree was cut down, the lovely
dryad who lived in it died. So, in those
days, most people did not wish to cut down
trees. They were afraid of hurting the
dryads.</p>

<p>"When trees grew old and fell, the
dryads died, too. Sometimes kind people
propped up old trees. Then the dryads
could live a little longer."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I could see one," said Polly.
"What did they wear?"</p>

<p>"No one knows exactly, Polly, because
no one ever saw a dryad. It is one of
those stories that have come to us from
thousands of years ago.<span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>"Most of the stories are not true. We
call them myths. And we like them very
much."</p>

<p>"Are myths as good as 'Once upon a
time' stories?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Peter. Get your mother
to tell you some, and see."</p>

<p>"Now I shall think of this story, when
I see our fire burning a dryad's house,"
said Polly.</p>

<p>"I shall play that there are dryads in
our trees, too. Perhaps, if I play hard
enough, one will really be there.</p>

<p>"When spring comes, I shall go to the
woods often. I know where there is a
hollow tree. That will make a good
dryad's house."</p>

<p>"Spring is coming soon," said mother.
"The cold winter is nearly over. But, first
of all, bedtime is coming. It has nearly
come, now. Say good night, Peter and
Polly. Then off with you."</p>

<p>So Peter and Polly said good night and
went upstairs to bed. Perhaps they dreamed
of dryads. Perhaps they dreamed of spring-time.
Perhaps they slept soundly and did
not dream at all.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
